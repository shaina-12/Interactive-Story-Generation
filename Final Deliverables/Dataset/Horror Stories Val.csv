A young man Billy Weaver is traveling in a cold winter night and seeks a place to stay,"A young man Billy Weaver is traveling in a cold winter night and seeks a place to stay. After searching a lot, he comes across a boarding house. He rings the bell and an old lady welcomes him inside. He signs the guest book and gives all the required details. While filling up the guest book, he reads the names and details of other guests who previously stayed there and finds their names quite familiar. The old lady offers some food and drinks to Billy but he refuses as he is tired and wants to go to bed. However, they have a conversation over some tea. Billy notices some peculiar things about the living room. The parrot is sitting quietly in the cage and a dog is lying near the fireplace. While talking, Billy asks about the other guests and the lady starts saying strange things. She says that one of her guests, Mr. Mulholland, had nice, soft skin. The situation gets ominous. Billy asks if the parrot is alive. The lady says neither the parrot nor the dog is alive. He panics and wants to get out immediately. He realizes that the names which appeared familiar were the names given in the newspaper about people who mysteriously disappeared. Finally, Billy asks if there have been any other guests, in the last three years, at the boarding house. The lady says none but him."
I walk into the dark and desolate room and I feel a wintery chill lingering on the air. I hear nothing,"I walk into the dark and desolate room and I feel a wintery chill lingering on the air. I hear nothing but a soft whistle of wind coming from a tiny crack in the window pane. The sour scent of stale lavender arises from a lonely incent stick in the corner and dances all around me. A taste of decomposing flowers abrubtly hits my mouth, as if I’d taken a bite or two of a rotting rose bush. Suddenly, I see a shadow emerge from the darkness. I stop still, clenching my heart and hoping this is all just a dream... My brain tells my body to run for the door but I am paralysed by fear and can not move an inch. As this gloomy force approaches me assuredly, I hear a whisper by my ear. “The dark is my home come and join me”, it says. I fall to the floor in sheer shock with tears streaming down my face. But now released from my immobilised state I have a chance to escape! As I hobble to the exit I hear a huge gust of wind rushing behind me. I open the door to quickly jump outside. But just as I do I feel a bitterly cold hand grab my leg. It pulls me back in and the door slams shut. “Time to go now”, the voice murmurs..."
"A couple of months ago, my friend's cousin (a single mother) bought a new cell phone. After a long day","A couple of months ago, my friend's cousin (a single mother) bought a new cell phone. After a long day of work, she came home, placed her phone on the counter, and went watch to TV; her son came to her and asked if he could play with her new phone. She told him not to call anyone or mess with text messages, and he agreed. At around 11:20, she was drowsy, so she decided to tuck her son in and go to bed. She walked to his room and saw that he wasn't there. She then ran over to her room to find him sleeping on her bed with the phone in his hand. Relieved, she picked her phone back up from his hand to inspect it. Browsing through it, she noticed only minor changes such as a new background, banner, etc., but then she opened up her saved pictures. She began deleting the pictures he had taken, until only one new picture remained. When she first saw it, she was in disbelief. It was her son sleeping on her bed, but the picture was taken by someone else above him... and it showed the left half of an elderly woman's face."
"In a century-old single-family home, strange occurrences have become commonplace","In a century-old single-family home, strange occurrences have become commonplace for the occupants, including the narrator and their siblings. One memorable incident involves the narrator's brother and his garage band friends. During a practice session in the basement one Sunday evening, the group decides to move the equipment to another location. As they leave, the brother realizes he left his food downstairs and returns alone. In the dimly lit basement, he notices a shadowy figure in his peripheral vision, evoking a sense of dread. Remembering advice from their upbringing, he confronts the presence with a mix of defiance and fear, cursing at it before hastily making his way upstairs, shutting off lights as he goes. Despite feeling a presence behind him, he refuses to look back until safely outside. Once in the truck with his friends, they question him about another person seen leaving the house with him. Confused, the brother explains that he works the graveyard shift and had already left for work, leaving the friends puzzled about who they saw accompanying him. The story captures a chilling encounter with the unknown, blending elements of the supernatural with mundane reality. Despite the brother's attempts to rationalize the experience, the mystery remains unsolved, leaving the lingering question of who—or what—walked behind him that night."
My older sister has a ghost that's followed her around for years.I lived with her once,"My older sister has a ghost that's followed her around for years.I lived with her once for about 3 months, and so much weird stuff happened in that time. All my sister would say to me when I mentioned it was that her ghost ""didn't like me being there."" Things like going to bed with everything locked up and switched off and waking up in the morning with the back door open, lights on and the kettle switched on. One night my sister and I were getting ready to go out and I'd asked to borrow her liquid foundation. I used it and put it back where she kept her makeup. Ten minutes later she's asking me for it and it was nowhere to be seen. She accused me of taking it and made me buy her a new one and refused to listen to my side of the story. About a year or so later when she was packing to move to a new house, she found the makeup in a shoebox with some old letters. The shoebox was in a zipped up suitcase that was underneath her bed. But probably the most scared I ever felt was one afternoon when I was the only one in the house (which never happened as four other people lived there). I'd arrived home from work and headed straight to the bathroom. All the doors/windows etc were closed. I was standing in the bathroom and started squeezing a pimple on my chin when a female voice in the hall said ""stop picking your zits!"" It was loud enough and sounded real enough and at the time I thought it was my sister. So I laughed, told her to ""fuck off"" and asked what she was doing for dinner. No answer. I stuck my head out into the hall. No one there. I searched the house top to bottom and there was no one home. I sat out on the front porch until someone else got home because I didn't want to be in there alone."
"As a child, the narrator experienced unsettling whispers in the darkness, prompting","As a child, the narrator experienced unsettling whispers in the darkness, prompting them to seek refuge in their mother's bed. However, one particular night close to Christmas, their fear took a tangible form when they spotted a strange red light at the foot of the stairs. Convinced it was Santa Claus, the child was about to descend when a commanding voice intervened, ordering them to stop. Disregarding the warning, the child proceeded down the stairs, only to be met with a chilling crash behind them. The following morning revealed inexplicable damage to the house: poinsettia lights torn down and a dry sink hurled from the wall, bearing marks of a forceful grip. Frightened and bewildered, the narrator kept silent about the terrifying ordeal. In the aftermath, the whispers ceased, leaving the child haunted by the memory of that harrowing night. As they grew older, the fear persisted, manifesting as a deep-seated dread of the dark, especially when confronted with shadowy stairwells. The incident left an indelible mark on the narrator, shaping their outlook on the world and instilling a lingering apprehension toward the unknown. Despite attempts to rationalize the events and seek logical explanations, the narrator found no solace. The encounter with an unseen force defied conventional explanation, leaving them grappling with unresolved trauma and an enduring fear of the darkness. Through the retelling of this unsettling childhood experience, the narrator conveys the profound impact it had on their psyche, underscoring the lingering effects of inexplicable phenomena and the enduring power of fear."
"I was babysitting my niece once while I was staying at my brother's place, ","I was babysitting my niece once while I was staying at my brother's place, and they had the baby camera setup so I could see her on the little TV it came with. I was studying and started dozing off when I heard some whispering and realized it was coming from the monitor. I initially thought it was some feedback or something, but when I looked at the TV there was a dark shadow near my niece's crib. I have never been more terrified in my life, but the shadow was clearly there where it had not been before. I ran to my niece's room and looked around and saw nothing, but I took her the hell out of there. I went back to the TV, and the shadow was clearly gone. I told my brother what happened and he pulled me aside and told me not to mention it to my sister-in-law because she'll freak out, but that he had seen that same thing several times now, with the same whispering. They stayed in that house for about four more years and when my niece was just learning to talk she would tell her mom about her 'special friend.' To this day, it scares the shit out of me. When they moved out, my brother told me my niece had become inconsolably sad because she would miss her 'friend.' Her mom would tell her she could bring him along but all she would say was that he couldn't leave the house. We have never to this day told her about that damn shadow, and she apparently never saw it."
I didn't know that's what it was called until much later. I was living in a house ,"I didn't know that's what it was called until much later. I was living in a house in Laguna Beach that had been there since the 1920s. In it's history, it had been a speakeasy, a brothel and a house for smuggling illegal immigrants. One day, my new wife and I were having an argument. I can't even recall what it was about. She walked down the block to get a cup of coffee and cool off, and I was alone in the house. The way the place was built was incredibly haphazard. There was a bedroom and living room on one side, then a bathroom with two entrances. On the other side of the bathroom was a hallway that had windows in one side and two bedrooms on the other. From my bedroom, I could look across the hall into the bathroom, then through the bathroom and down the other hall. I was standing at my dresser, and I just noticed movement out the corner of my eye, and looked down there. There was... and honest to god, this gives me goose bumps just typing it, 17 years later, a black figure. It was maybe three feet tall, and it was only vaguely humanoid. it looked like black scribbles, like someone had scribbled a human shape, but the scribbles moved, like electricity arcing, that's the best way to describe it. There was no sound that I could remember. I distinctly remember when I saw it I wasn't afraid, just like, WTF? Then it noticed me looking at it. I can't say it turned around, it just, focused on me I guess. THEN I was scared. I didn't move, didn't scream, nothing, I was just frozen, because it just fucking came at me, it RUSHED down the hall towards me. I have no idea what it intended, but as soon as it entered the bathroom, the door closest to me just SLAMMED shut on it. I screamed. I yelled for my wife. She wasn't home. I went the fuck outside, into the daylight, and didn't go back in until she got home about 10 minutes later. I don't believe in ghosts. I don't believe I saw something supernatural, but I know I saw something. I don't know what it was"
"The Princess's brief takeover of the message board baffled users, as it defied","The Princess's brief takeover of the message board baffled users, as it defied conventional understanding of its function. They questioned the limits of her abilities and whether she could strike again. Upon thorough examination of their data, they made a startling realization: the Princess had always been present on the board, embedded in every image and interaction. She thrived on attention and observation, feeding off the thoughts and perceptions directed towards her. Recognizing her as a manifestation of ""living fiction,"" they understood that their collective focus during a livestream had empowered her to momentarily breach the digital realm and communicate with them directly. In a desperate bid to protect themselves, they removed all images of her, knowing that ceasing to observe her would weaken her influence. However, the narrator fears it may be too late, as fellow members of their community have gone silent, possibly falling victim to the Princess's grasp. Despite this, they acknowledge her plight for survival and the importance of keeping her memory alive. The narrator issues a warning to readers, urging them to recognize the danger they now face as targets of the Princess's attention. They advise against engaging with her in any form, emphasizing the importance of self-preservation over curiosity or heroism. The narrator's hope lies in providing enough information to keep others safe, urging them to heed one simple rule: if they encounter the Princess, they must disconnect immediately to protect themselves from her influence."
"“Our old house was on a corner, and in lieu of a backyard had a side yard","“Our old house was on a corner, and in lieu of a backyard had a side yard, with a small deck that wrapped around the back. The dining room had patio doors that lead out to the back and we would have BBQs and such back there. When I was about 14, we only had one desktop computer and one laptop for the family. My brother and I would fight over the desktop (that’s where Diablo 2 was installed!) so I would use the laptop to write music. On one particular night, my brother had a friend over and they were downstairs doing whatever and I was at the dining room table on the laptop. As I was wrapped up in my writing, I didn’t pay much attention to my surroundings. I heard a knock on the patio door, which startled me. I looked up, expecting my brother or his friend (the basement had a door that lead to the back deck as well.) Standing at the door, and waving was a person (could not tell sex or age) wearing a Halloween pig mask. Thinking it was my brother or his friend I mouthed “good one” and gave the person the finger and they walked away. As soon as they left I went downstairs to give them shit, and to my surprise and dismay… They were both sitting on the couch playing PlayStation. They swore up and down it wasn’t either of them, and there was no way one of them would have had time to get downstairs and unmask bore getting on the couch. To this day, I have no idea who it was that knocked and waved.”"
