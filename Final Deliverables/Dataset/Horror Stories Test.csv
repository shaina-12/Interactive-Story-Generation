A family friend of mine used to work in private wealth management. One of her,"A family friend of mine used to work in private wealth management. One of her jobs was diversification of her clients assets on the stock market.Out of nowhere she gets a call from a representative of one of her very big private clients to sell all the stocks of a big airline and move the liquidity somewhere else. No buts, and if needed they could sell in up to 5% below market as long as the shares are sold quickly. This was extremely weird, as the stock price of the company was pretty stable, and specifically this clients portfolio was heavily hedged with this stake, but she didn’t think much of it – oftentimes her clients did this for personal reasons (such as having a bad experience on a plane of the company or etc). Two days later one of her colleagues that she shared this peculiar story told her how the airline stock price started slowly but surely falling – some people were selling off their shares too, which were gladly bought by the market at increasing prices. The next day AA Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the WTC in New York. The stock market was closed for another week.”"
"““I went camping by myself in Maine, one night I woke up at like 3am. Not being able ","““I went camping by myself in Maine, one night I woke up at like 3am. Not being able to fall asleep I just laid there listening to the woods. Then I heard a faint hello…. I was petrified. I felt so vulnerable in the tent. I never figured out what it was.” “Would you like to come live in my basement?” “When I was 17 and worked in retail as a cashier, I had a very old couple come through my line buying a wok. The husband who was at least 85 started making conversation with me about the wok, and asked if I liked Chinese food.“Yeah, I like Chinese.” “Do you want to go out with me to get some Chinese?” He winks at me. “N-no sir.” “Oh. Well.” He looks a bit disappointed and turns to look at his wife who is on the phone with someone. “Would you at least like to come home with me and live in my basement?”  “…no.”  The rest of the transaction took place in terrified silence. His wife never said a word. I wonder to this day if he was trying to joke, because he sounded so sincere, or if he was suffering from dementia or something else that make him not realize how creepy that sounds to someone young enough to be your great grandchild.” "
“I was ambling down an old country highway in NW Georgia on my motorcycle,"“I was ambling down an old country highway in NW Georgia on my motorcycle (750 Vulcan) when I spotted an ambulance coming the opposite way. I pulled over, and a pickup truck pulled over behind me. In my rear-view mirror I see the passenger get out with a baseball bat and start hustling my way. I didn’t even look, just dropped it into gear and hauled ass. What followed was the most harrowing experience I’ve had in life as this pickup truck proceeds to chase me all over the place for about 20 minutes. I’m unfamiliar with the area and my bike was not meant for going fast around turns, so I’ve got no room for error and it’s all I can do to stay out in front of these guys. I’m blowing through four-way intersections in a bid to get some distance and come up with a plan, but they are hell-bent on catching me. I finally manage to get pointed towards the highway and into the cover of other cars, but then traffic stops on a bridge. The truck is three cars behind me, and I’m thinking if I can just get out to the highway I’m probably home free because my Vulcan can go fairly fast in a straight line. In my mirrors I can see that passenger snaking through the cars on the bridge, so I lane split (illegal in GA) and make the on-ramp, hammer down and I’m gone baby gone. Never went back to that town. As far as I know this was an unprovoked attack of the hillbilly variety, because prior to the ambulance I hadn’t even seen another vehicle, I don’t ride particularly fast, and I don’t believe in loud pipes. I got lucky as hell, seeing him come up behind me like that.”"
"On a cold winter night, the narrator, a petite man, embarked on a journey to meet a friend halfway","On a cold winter night, the narrator, a petite man, embarked on a journey to meet a friend halfway, both lacking transportation. At 3 am, as he walked along a deserted road wearing a black jacket with the hood up, a car pulled into a driveway behind him, causing an uneasy feeling to wash over him. Although half-expecting a friendly offer of a ride, he remained cautious and continued walking, ignoring the car. The atmosphere grew tense as the car remained stationary, its interior dark and the figure of a large man barely visible. Despite typically being unfazed by such situations, the narrator felt a sense of dread. Upon turning to face the car, he noticed the man's intense gaze fixed upon him, reminiscent of a menacing movie scene.Attempting to acknowledge the presence, the narrator waved, but the man remained silent and motionless. Feeling increasingly unsettled, the narrator quickened his pace. However, the car began to reverse, prompting him to turn and face it. As the car crept closer, the narrator, now hoodless, awaited its passing. Unexpectedly, the car halted beside him, and the passenger window rolled down, revealing the grimacing face of the man inside. No words were exchanged before the man abruptly sped away, leaving the narrator bewildered and shaken by the encounter. Despite its seemingly mundane nature, the tense interaction left an indelible mark on the narrator, haunting him with its inexplicable intensity."
"When my grandmother’s second husband was in his death throes, he had a habit of knocking ","When my grandmother’s second husband was in his death throes, he had a habit of knocking on the bedroom wall to get her attention, since he didn’t have the strength to shout. This went on for a long time, because even though he was deathly ill he kept holding on. I was about seven years old at the time, and living with them. Not long after he died, my grandmother told me that she was sitting at the dining room table alone one morning as they used to together, quietly drinking her coffee, when suddenly she heard the knocking on the wall again. She heard it clear as day. It wasn’t me, because I was in their bedroom sleeping in her bed, and she could see me sleeping at that (it was a small house). She claims she heard it on more than one occasion.As the years went by, other strange things happened. I began to have dreams of a young man in a navy uniform I’d never met before, watching us sleep in the house, or standing over me in my bedroom. I sometimes felt an eerie presence in the house, and at one point heard a disembodied voice call me by name in the middle of the day. My grandmother almost got into a car accident once, and nearly missed hitting a semi when all at once she swore to God she could smell his cologne like he was in the car. She also had odd dreams of her husband coming back to the house, telling her he hadn’t gone anywhere and he wasn’t dead. Finally, a bird began to visit the house some days. I saw it and heard it myself. The bird would fly to her bedroom window, and tap on the window with its beak. It did this many times, and we learned to recognize it. That was the last sign before the odd occurrences began to taper off. My grandmother died a couple of years ago, and afterwards for the first time ever, I felt like the presence in the house had left us."
"I live in the sticks in Michigan, but a decent sized neighborhood with about twenty","I live in the sticks in Michigan, but a decent sized neighborhood with about twenty houses. Our streets make two circles. I was home with my toddler, who was taking a nap. I’m on my back porch, drinking coffee. Around noon. There’s a piercing scream that seems to last at least thirty seconds, I’m startled, so I go out of my fence and walk up my driveway to look around.”There’s a man hauling ass down the street, cradling his arm and dripping blood on the concrete. He sees me and shouts, “Did you see that fucking cat?! Which way did it go?!” I saw no animal.I asked if he needed help, but he declined, saying an ambulance was on its way and just needed to find the cat. Perplexed, I pull off my long sleeve and hand it to the guy, telling him to at least wrap his injury. He holds up his arm, and his fingers are mangled.“A housecat did this to you?!” As I gently help him wrap his and.“This wasn’t a regular cat…we just have to find him!!!!” So I help him look. So do a few of our neighbors. Ambulance arrives a few houses down at his place, so we walk down and sit on the curb. Suddenly, commotion from the other way and a half dozen people sprinting to the cul-de-sac to corner this animal. It disappears around a house, and we hear a volley of barking. Another man comes from behind the house, running at full speed towards the ambo. I’m still sitting with bloody guy, and running guy gives him a tissue. I almost fainted and probably would have if I were standing- in it was bloody guy’s thumb and first finger, with a bit of tissue and nasty."
Worked in a tattoo shop where two of the past owners had died. One of them died,"Worked in a tattoo shop where two of the past owners had died. One of them died just a block away from the shop, and it was long rumored that the shop was haunted/cursed. Weird stuff would happen like speakers/decorative knives falling off shelves overnight and smashing through our glass-topped light table, and the lights would flicker on and off. One late night I was alone in the shop tattooing some eighteen-year-old kid and the light above me started flickering. My lights above my station had always been perfectly lit so this seemed unusual. It was flickering so much that it was starting to get annoying and I began to feel nervous, even though I really didn’t believe the shop was haunted. Finally after a few minutes of this I stopped tattooing for a second, looked up at the light, and said in my head, “okay [dead shop owner’s name], I get it, you’re here. Can you stop messing with my light, please?” It was supposed to be kind of a joke. The light stopped flickering INSTANTLY. It went back to just shining regular ol’ light and I went back to tattooing, pretty shaken up. From that moment I knew the dead shop owner was there and I knew he was just causing occasional mayhem to fuck with us, nothing malicious but definitely haunting that place.”"
Once a lady lived in an old house. Her neighbours told her that it was a haunted,"Once a lady lived in an old house. Her neighbours told her that it was a haunted house, but the lady did not believe the neighbours.  When the lady was living in the house, she was happy to see that the house was completely furnished .She did not see anything move right in the house. On the day of the first night in the house, she got into bed in a very good mood. She was just going to sleep when she heard an odd sound, way off in some distance. It sounded like this: “My home, My home, My home.” She tried to ignore the sound at first but she could not. Finally, she decided to get out of bed and investigate the sound.  When she opened her bedroom door, the sound became louder: “My home, My home, My home.”  The lady walked down the hallway. Then the sound got louder: “My home, My home, My home.” She headed downstairs very fast. Now it was even louder! “My home, My home,My home.”And when she went into the dining room. It was so loud!“My home,My home,My home.”The sound was coming from a corner of the room ,she realised.She walked in that direction. “My home, My home, My home.”There was a chest of drawers in the corner. The sound was very dangerous now. “My home, My home, My home.”The lady opened the top drawer. There was nothing there. “My home, My home, My home.”She opened the second drawer. There was nothing there. “My home, My home, My home.”She opened the third drawer. There was nothing there. “My home, My home, My home.” Finally, the lady opened the bottom drawer, and there she saw something strange such that the voice stopped coming. It was a roll of wrapping paper in it! Was it the roll that was speaking? Or Was it some ghost? No one could investigate the reason to date. If you could find out the reason,  let your friends also know about it. "
"“I’ve never lived in a haunted house, but my mother did as a teen,” writes","“I’ve never lived in a haunted house, but my mother did as a teen,” writes Reddit.com user PatentedSpaceHook, recounting a true event. “Other houses on her street had strange things going on too. A few homes away from her lived a family. One night, the daughter went to bed with a bad headache. The next day, she was dead—she’d passed away from an aneurysm.“After her funeral, the family went away to get their minds off the tragedy, and the father asked my uncle—my mom’s brother—to check on their pets. My mom and dad (who were dating at the time) went with him; my mother had heard there was a grand piano, and she wanted to play it. My dad was studying to be a veterinarian.“After entering the house, my uncle and my father headed to the basement to see the animals, and my mother went to the piano on the ground floor. She was playing it when she felt something brush her ankles. She thought a cat must have left the basement and walked past her. She kept playing. And then she felt it again.“She looked under the piano and saw nothing. When she started again, she felt hands clasp her legs tightly. She dashed to the basement door, called my uncle and father, and waited for them. Back outside, my uncle could tell my mom was rattled and asked what was wrong. “She told him what had happened, and he turned white. He told her the daughter who had died used to play a game with her father. When he played the piano, she’d crawl underneath, grab his ankles and push his feet up and down on the pedals.”"
"“The ambulance company that I used to work for had a ‘haunted’ ambulance: rig 12,” recounts","“The ambulance company that I used to work for had a ‘haunted’ ambulance: rig 12,” recounts Reddit.com user Zerbo. “A lot of EMTs had stories about it, but I never put much stock in paranormal stuff. That is, until I had my own experience with rig 12. “My partner and I were working in a rural community at 3 a.m., and it was pitch dark and completely quiet. We were both dozing; I was in the driver’s seat, and she was in the passenger seat. I woke up to a muffled voice, but I thought my partner was talking. I told her I was trying to sleep and closed my eyes. I distinctly heard a male voice say, ‘Oh my God, am I dying?’ followed by a few seconds of heavy breathing. My partner and I sat up straight and looked back into the patient compartment, where it sounded like the voice had come from. “Things were quiet for a couple of seconds; then we heard the click of an oxygen-bottle regulator and a hiss, as if it was leaking. I turned on the lights, and we ran out of the rig. I thought a transient might have climbed in while we were asleep, so we opened the rear doors. No one was there. I checked the oxygen bottles; neither was opened. We didn’t sleep much after that.”"
"“My neighbor Diane and I had a playful poltergeist for years, and we called it Billy.” So begins ","“My neighbor Diane and I had a playful poltergeist for years, and we called it Billy.” So begins Reddit.com user abbys_alibi in their real-life ghost story. “I’d come home and find something put in a weird place: milk in a cupboard, toilet paper in the fridge, laundry detergent in the bathtub. Diane once called to ask if Billy had been around, because she couldn’t find a gallon of milk. We finally found it outside on her back steps. And sugar … darn sugar! Every morning, my sugar bowl was empty. “When I’d had enough, I would point to Diane’s home and yell, ‘Go see Diane!’ Within five minutes, I’d get a call from her. ‘Thanks a lot,’ she’d say. He’d gone and pulled shenanigans at her place. This occurred for the entire two years we lived there. No one believed us—not even our husbands. My mother thought someone was stealing from us when we were sleeping or out of the house. My sister believed something was going on but didn’t know what. I still can’t explain any of it.”"
"“One night when I was 10, I was woken up by my bedroom door opening, followed by someone","“One night when I was 10, I was woken up by my bedroom door opening, followed by someone sitting on my bed,” Reddit.com user kmendo4 recalls of a childhood brush with a very persistent ghostly apparition. “I felt my leg grazed and the bed sink under a person’s weight. It’s just Mom, I thought, and I opened my eyes. “It was not my mom. I found an eyeless boy—he had black, empty sockets—about my age sitting at the foot of my bed. He extended his hand, and in it was a little box. I was startled but reached out. He pulled back. I reached again and said, ‘Give it.’ Then I blinked, and when I reopened my eyes, he was gone. But I could still see the imprint where he’d sat on my bed. “Fast-forward five years. My girlfriend came over to do homework. After she finished, she took a nap while she waited for her parents. When they arrived, I tried waking her up. She opened her eyes suddenly, looking up at a corner where the wall met the ceiling. She pointed there and went back to sleep. I shook her again. She came to full consciousness, and I explained what she’d done. She looked haunted. ‘Up on the wall, I saw a little boy with no eyes. He was there, in a Spider-Man pose, staring at me.’ I freaked out and told her my story about the same kid.“F ast-forward another five years. I was with the same girlfriend, and we had a 2-year-old. We were living in my parents’ house, in my old room. My daughter started waking up at the same time every night, and she’d talk. After a while, I noticed she had almost the same conversation every night. I playfully asked her once whom she was talking to. She said, ‘It’s a little boy. He’s nice. He’s lost and looking for his mommy.’ My daughter’s nightly conversations continued until we got our own place later that year.”"
"Here is a story that dates back to 1910, but almost any student at Huntingdon College in Montgomery","Here is a story that dates back to 1910, but almost any student at Huntingdon College in Montgomery, Alabama, should recognize it. That’s because the events that led up to it are said to have actually happened. As the story goes, in 1910, a young woman who was new to the school was known for her love of the color red. Sadly, she was also known for being “strange” and a “loner.” As the first term got underway, the young woman grew increasingly isolated. Eventually, she took her life by slashing her wrists. Her body was discovered in a red gown, drenched in blood. From then on, students and faculty have been reporting sightings of a young woman dressed all in red. She’s appeared all around the college’s campus. The figure, dwelling in perpetual isolation, is often cited as a reminder of the importance of being kind to one’s peers."
This true ghost story might strike you as more “aw” than “eek”—but only until you consider,"This true ghost story might strike you as more “aw” than “eek”—but only until you consider that we really have no idea what our four-legged friends can sense that we cannot, including the scariest of scary stories. Can dogs see ghosts? Well, there are plenty of dog experts out there, including veterinarians, who will attest to the fact that there’s “lots of documentation that could support the notion that dogs can sense paranormal activity,” as Jesus Aramendi, DVM, a senior veterinarian for Chewy, put it.And then there’s the fact that this story came to Reader’s Digest directly from a well-known psychic medium, Kristy Robinett, who has used her ghost-whispering skills to help detectives solve confounding cases. “Marlene settled onto her side of the bed and patted Jack’s pillow beside her,” Robinett told Reader’s Digest. “A year had gone by, but Marlene was still adjusting to widowhood. Maybe it was crazy to think that after 40 years of marriage, she would ever adjust. Elmer the golden retriever seemed to understand this from the very first. That cold, moonless night when Marlene returned, alone, from the hospital, Elmer did something he’d never done before. He jumped up onto Jack’s side of the bed and lay his head on the pillow. “Jack would never have allowed it,” Robinett pointed out, “but Marlene didn’t shoo him off. Instead, she lay down beside Elmer and let the peaceful sound of his snoring lull her to sleep. The next night was the same, and the night after that.“ Over the past year, it had grown into a comforting routine. But not tonight. Tonight was the first time Elmer had left Marlene alone in the bed since Jack’s passing. But hearing nails clicking on the wood floor downstairs, Marlene recognized the sound of Elmer requesting ‘outsies.’ With a sigh, Marlene made her way down the stairs to the foyer. But Elmer wasn’t pacing in front of the big oak door. Rather, he was dancing. And wagging. And wiggling and bowing. Just like he used to do when Jack would come home from work.”To Marlene, it felt as if Jack had just come home, and Robinett, who is known for her intuition about these things, believes that is, indeed, what happened."
Roanoke Colony was one of the first European settlements in the United States. Located,"Roanoke Colony was one of the first European settlements in the United States. Located on an island off the coast of what is now the state of North Carolina, the colony was established in 1587 under the auspices of the first Queen Elizabeth. Soon after, the colony’s leader, John White, returned to England, where the settlers came from.His trip was meant to be brief. He was only meant to grab supplies and return to the new world. But political upheaval (in the form of England’s war with Spain) prevented White from returning until 1590. It was only three years, but a lot had changed when John White returned. In fact, the entire colony—consisting, at the time, of 115 people, including a newborn baby by the name of Virginia Dare—was gone. Just up and vanished. All that was left was a post onto which the word Croatoan had been carved. “Croatoan” referred to the name of a native tribe that had been on good terms with the settlers. So White thought the colonists had moved to Croatoan Island (now known as Hatteras, North Carolina). But they had not. It remains one of the most famous disappearances that no one can explain. What’s more, there’s never been any evidence to suggest the colony was massacred. Many believe that baby Virginia grew into a beautiful young woman, one who eventually fell into a doomed love affair with a native warrior by the name of Okisko. To this day, she haunts the woods in search of her man, often in the form of a diaphanous white deer, one that always vanishes at dawn. According to NCPedia, a state encyclopedia maintained by the North Carolina Government & Heritage Library, longtime residents of the island have no doubt that the identity of the phantom deer is the ghost of Virginia Dare. If you’re itching for an explanation as to how an entire colony could just disappear that’s not simply more ghost stories, you’re not alone. On the positive side, it’s one of a handful of mysteries that could be solved in the next decade."
