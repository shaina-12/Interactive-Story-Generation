We began to search a place for a camp with fresh water supply and some fruit trees nearby. When we had gone ahead, we heard mysterious cry. I said to Praveen, “What bird can it be calling so mysteriously?” He was dazed but said, “It might be a bird, animal or a demon that swallows the victims alive”. The cry was heard again and to our amazement we saw a shadow approaching. “Look, Praveen! We are gone, I said.” He was terrorized and yelled like a mad man. I too yelled hysterically and grappled with the shadowy figure. To our amazement, Ram had thought to chill our blood with fun. The wild cries could still be heard. We selected a place in between the trees and the fresh water spring at the east-southern coast for setting up a camp. We brought the dry branches, wood, dried grass and leaves from the nearby trees.

"He looked around, surrounded by his friend as they enjoyed the view. Today was a good day, he could","He looked around, surrounded by his friend as they enjoyed the view. Today was a good day, he could feel it. The day he’d been waiting for, pushing for. He’d just have to wiggle a bit more and it would be his turn, his turn to explore the beautiful world that had laid before him since he was born. He looked at his friends, some were larger, some were smaller but it didn’t matter. They would explore the world together! Even Larry at the end who’d looked a bit sick lately. He readied his voice and gave the command and they began pushing and shoving. Before they knew it, it had happened. They were free, the adventure had begun and they were now rushing towards new and unknown territories. Places they had only seen from afar, creatures they’d only heard fairytales of and a new home amongst new and exciting friends. The landing had been quite rough but they had managed. Larry had gotten separated from them but not to worry, he would probably catch up later once he’d recovered. Their next journey began and if he had to say it, it hadn’t been as luxurious and exciting as people had been telling the stories, not yet anyway. It had been a rough couple of days but it could only go up from here. Larry hadn’t come back yet but he could still make it although their room had been quite small it hadn’t seemed like they had moved a lot. Next time he was definitely upgrading their tickets, they had been stuck between at least a thousand other passengers and he was happy he’d been in the middle. He couldn’t imagine the guys on the sides, they must’ve been crushed. The next time he woke they had apparently arrived because they were all sitting on a balcony. The view was kind of horrible, and the sun wasn’t nearly as warm as it used to be. Now that he looked more closely there also seemed to quite a lot of them, he’d only ever seen one at home. All of that was quickly forgotten when he saw the creatures walked past him. One of them was moving straight towards them. They seemed a lot larger. A lot larger! It picked them up and dropped them. It seemed a bit rough but at least, they had been the only travelers this time. He’d have to talk to the agency when he figured out who they were. Now they were sat in what appeared to be a see-through barrier. This place also had multiple suns but these were warmer than the former place. Another one of the creatures moved towards them, much smaller than the others but it seemed to be very interested in them. It hovered over them for a bit before one of its claws moved towards him. It grabbed a hold of him and before he knew it, it ripped him from the others. He looked down at his friends as he moved towards the little creature. As the boy took a bite of the banana, his mother looked at him. “Oh Jonathan, we’re having dinner in less than an hour. You won’t be able to eat anything!” and they both laughed as he threw the rest of it out."

"A Swiss family in the hold of a sailing ship, weathering a great storm. The ship's crew evacuates","A Swiss family in the hold of a sailing ship, weathering a great storm. The ship's crew evacuates without them, so William, Elizabeth, and their four sons (Fritz, Ernest, Jack, and Franz) are left to survive alone. As the ship tosses about, William prays that God will spare them. The ship survives the night, and the family finds themselves within sight of a tropical desert island. The following day, they decide to get to the island they can see beyond the reef. With much effort, they construct a vessel out of tubs. After they fill the tubs with food, ammunition, and other items of value they can safely carry, they row toward the island. Two dogs from the ship, Turk and Juno, swim beside them. The ship's cargo of livestock (including a cow, a donkey, two goats, six sheep, a ram, a pig, chickens, ducks, geese, and pigeons), guns and powder, carpentry tools, books, a disassembled pinnace and provisions have survived. Upon reaching the island, the family set up a makeshift camp. William knows that they must prepare for a long time on the island and his thoughts are as much on provisions for the future as on their immediate wants. William and his oldest son Fritz spend the next day exploring the island. The family spends the next few days securing themselves against hunger. William and Fritz make several trips to the ship to bring everything useful from the vessel ashore. The domesticated animals on the ship are towed back to the island. There is also a great store of firearms and ammunition, hammocks for sleeping, carpenter's tools, lumber, cooking utensils, silverware, and dishes. Initially, they construct a treehouse, but as time passes (and after Elizabeth is injured climbing the stairs down from it), they settle in a more permanent dwelling in part of a cave. Fritz rescues a young Englishwoman named Jenny Montrose, who was shipwrecked elsewhere on their island. The book covers more than ten years. William and the older boys explore various environments and develop homes and gardens at various sites about the island. Ultimately, the father wonders if they will ever see the rest of humanity again. Eventually, a British ship that is in search of Jenny Montrose anchors near the island and is discovered by the family. The captain is given the journal containing the story of their life on the island, which is eventually published. Several family members continue to live tranquilly on their island, while several return to Europe with the British."
"In 1933, nine-year-old Cassie Logan lives in rural Mississippi with her three brothers, Stacey","In 1933, nine-year-old Cassie Logan lives in rural Mississippi with her three brothers, Stacey (twelve years old), Christopher-John (seven years old), and Little Man (six years old). Unlike most black families during this time, the Logan family owns the land on which they reside. It originally belonged to a white plantation owner, Harlan Granger, who sold it to cover his taxes during Reconstruction. Rather than a single, overarching storyline, the bulk of the novel consists of several intertwining plots, each involving one or more members of the Logan family and illustrating various aspects of black/white interactions during the nadir of American race relations. Several episodes feature black characters being humiliated by powerful white citizens and being forced to weigh the potential cost of standing up for themselves. At school, Cassie and Little Man notice that the books they use were originally distributed to the white children and given to the black students once they wore out. Cassie's father, David Logan, visits the family from his job on the railroad during the holidays. After Cassie is humiliated by Lillian Jean Simms, a white girl, she pretends to forgive Lillian Jean and becomes friends with her long enough to learn sensitive information about the Simms family. Cassie assaults Lillian Jean and forces her to apologize for all the humiliation she inflicted on her, then threatens to reveal all of Lillian Jean's secrets if she tells anyone what happened. When Cassie's mother, a school teacher, catches Stacy's friend T.J. cheating in class, T.J. gets her fired from her job, with the help of the Wallace family. Cassie's mother, in turn, organizes a boycott of the Wallaces' store because they are the cause of most of the trouble between the blacks and the whites, as well as possibly being members of the Ku Klux Klan. Later, David and his hired hand Mr. Morrison are attacked on the road, with the former ending shot, albeit surviving. Mr. Morrison brutally trashes the attackers, who turn out to be the Wallaces. As a result, the white community forces the bank to call the Logans' mortgage. David’s brother Hammer sells his car to pay it off and avoid losing the family land. T.J. ends his friendship with Stacey and befriends Lillian Jean’s two older brothers, R.W. and Melvin Simms. The Simms boys convince T.J. to help them burgle a store, though in the process, Jim Lee Barnett, the store owner, is killed by the Simms boys, who set T.J. up to take the blame. The book ends with T.J. about to be lynched for the death of Barnett when the cotton fields catch fire and the community bands together to stop the fire from spreading. Cassie realizes that her father set the fire to save T.J. Stacey asks what T.J.'s fate will be. David tells the children T.J. will likely be convicted of Barnett's murder and may be executed. Cassie, overwhelmed by the news, silently goes to bed. Although Cassie never liked T.J., she cries for him and the land."

"The director of the film was a notorious perfectionist, driving his crew and cast to exhaustion","The director of the film was a notorious perfectionist, driving his crew and cast to exhaustion with endless retakes until each scene met his exacting standards.
