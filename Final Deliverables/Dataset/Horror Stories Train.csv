"Pioneers used to entertain themselves by telling scary stories. At night they might gather in somebody's cabin,","Pioneers used to entertain themselves by telling scary stories. At night they might gather in somebody's cabin, or around a fire, and see who could scare the others the most. Some girls and boys in my town do the same thing today. They get together at somebody's house, and they turn out the lights and eat popcorn, and scare one another half to death. Telling scary stories is something people have done for thousands of years, for most of us like being scared in that way. Since there isn't any danger, we think it is fun. There are a great many scary stories to tell. There are ghost stories. There are tales of witches, devils, bogey- men, zombies, and vampires. There are tales of monstrous creatures and of other dangers. There even are stories that make us laugh   at all this scariness. Some of these tales are very old, and they are told around the world. And most have the same origins. They are based on things that people saw or heard or experienced — or thought they did. Many years ago a young prince became famous for a scary story he started to tell, but did not finish. His name was Mamillius, and he probably was nine or ten years old. William Shakespeare told about him in The Winter's Tale. It was on a dark winter's day that his mother, the queen, asked him for a story. ""A sad tale's best for winter,"" he said. ""I have one of sprites and goblins."" ""Do your best to frighten me with your sprites,"" she said. ""You're powerful at it."" 'I shall tell it softly,"" he said. ""Yond crickets shall not hear it."" And he began, ""There was a man dwelt by a church- yard."" But that was as far as he got. For at that moment the king came in and arrested the queen and took her away. And soon after that, Mamillius died. No one knows how he would have finished his story. If you started as he did, what would you tell? Most scary stories are, of course, meant to be told. They are more scary that way. But how you tell them is important. As Mamillius knew, the best way is to speak softly, so that your listeners lean forward to catch your words, and to speak slowly, so that your voice sounds scary. And the best time to tell these stories is at night. In the dark and the gloom, it is easy for someone listening to imagine all sorts of strange and scary things."
A boy was digging at the edge of the garden when he saw a big toe. He tried to pick,"A boy was digging at the edge of the garden when he saw a big toe. He tried to pick it up, but it was stuck to something. So he gave it a good hard jerk, and it came off in his hand. Then he heard something groan and scamper away. The boy took the toe into the kitchen and showed it to his mother. ""It looks nice and plump,"" she said. ""I'll  put it in the soup, and we'll have it for supper."" That night his father carved the toe into three pieces. and they each had a piece. Then they did the dishes, and when it got dark they went to bed. The boy fell asleep almost at once. But in the middle of the night, a sound awakened him. It was something out in the street. It was a voice, and it was calling to him. ""Where is my to-o-o-o-o-e?"" it groaned. When the boy heard that, he got very scared. But he thought. It doesn't know where I am. It never will find me."" Then he heard the voice once more. Only now it was closer. Where is my to-o-o-o-o-e?"" it groaned. The boy pulled the blankets over his head and closed his eyes. ""I'll go to sleep,"" he thought. ""When I wake up it will be gone."" But soon he heard the back door open, and again he heard the voice. ""Where is my to-o-o-o-o-e?"" it groaned. Then the boy heard footsteps move through the kitchen into the dining room, into the living room, into the front hall. Then slowly they climbed the stairs. Closer and closer they came. Soon they were in the upstairs hall. Now they were outside his door. ""Where is my to-o-o-o-o-e?"" the voice groaned. His door opened. Shaking with fear, he listened as the footsteps slowly moved through the dark toward his bed. Then they stopped. Where is my to-o-o-o-o-e?"" the voice groaned. (At this point, pause. Then jump at the person next to you and shout:) "" YOU'VE GOT IT!"" ""The Big Toe"" also has another ending. When the boy hears the voice calling for its toe, he finds a strange-looking creature up inside the chimney. The boy is so frightened he can't move. He just stands there and stares at it. Finally he asks: ""W-w-w-what you got such big eyes for?"" And the creature answers: ""To look you thro-o-o ugh and thro-o-o-ugh!"" ""W-w-w-what you got such big claws for?"" ""To scra-a-a-tch up your gra-a-a-a-ve!"" ""W-w-w-what you got such a big mouth for?"" ""To swallow you who-o-o-le!"" ""W-w-w-what you got such sharp teeth for?"" ""TO CHOMP YOUR BONES!"""

"There was an old woman who lived all by herself, and she was very lonely. Sitting in the kitchen one night","There was an old woman who lived all by herself, and she was very lonely. Sitting in the kitchen one night, she said, “Oh, I wish I had some company.' 7 No sooner had she spoken than down the chimney tumbled two feet from which the flesh had rotted. The old woman's eyes bulged with terror. Then two legs dropped to the hearth and attached themselves to the feet. Then a body tumbled down, then two arms, and a man's head. As the old woman watched, the parts came together into a great, gangling man. The man danced around and around the room. Faster and faster he went. Then he stopped, and he looked into her eyes. “What do you come for?"" she asked in a small voice that shivered and shook. “What do I come for?"" he said. “I come — for YOU!”"
There was a haunted house where every night a bloody head fell down the chimney. At least that's what ,"There was a haunted house where every night a bloody head fell down the chimney. At least that's what people said. So nobody would stay there overnight. Then a rich man offered two hundred dollars to who- ever would do it. And this boy said he would try if he could have his dog with him. So it was all settled. The very next night the boy went to the house with his dog. To make it more cheerful, he started a fire in the fireplace. Then he sat in front of the fire and waited, and his dog waited with him. For a while nothing happened. But a little after mid- night he heard someone singing softly and sadly off in the woods. The singing sounded something like this: ""Me tie dough-ty walker!"" ""It's just somebody singing,"" the boy told himself, but he was frightened. Then his dog answered the song! Softly and sadly, it sang: ""Lynchee kinchy colly molly dingo dingo!"" The boy could not believe his ears. His dog had never uttered a word before. Then a few minutes later, he heard the singing again. Now it was closer and louder, but the words were the same: ""Me tie dough-ty walker!"" This time the boy tried to stop his dog from answering. He was afraid that whoever was singing would hear it and come after them. But his dog paid no attention, and again it sang: ""Lynchee kinchy colly molly dingo dingo!"" A half-hour later the boy heard the singing again. Now it was in the back yard, and the song was the same: ""Me tie dough-ty walker!"" Again the boy tried to keep his dog quiet. But the dog sang out louder than ever: ""Lynchee kinchy colly molly dingo dingo!"" Soon the boy heard the singing again. Now it was coming down the chimney: ""Me tie dough-ty walker!"" The dog sang right back: ""Lynchee kinchy colly molly dingo dingo!"" Suddenly a bloody head fell out of the chimney. It missed the fire and landed right next to the dog. The dog took one look and fell over — dead from fright. The head turned and stared at the boy. Slowly it opened its mouth, and — Some say this rhyme doesn't mean anything. Others are not so sure.

Ted Martin and Sam Miller were good friends. They spent a lot of time together. On this particular night,"Ted Martin and Sam Miller were good friends. They spent a lot of time together. On this particular night they were sitting on a fence near the post office talking about one thing and another. There was a field of turnips across the road. Suddenly they saw something crawl out of the field and stand up. It looked like a man, but in the dark it was hard to tell for sure. Then it was gone. But soon it appeared again. It walked halfway across the road, then it turned around and went back into the field. Then it came out a third time and started toward them. By now Ted and Sam were scared, and they started run- ning. But when they finally stopped, they decided they were being foolish. They weren't sure what had scared them. So they decided to go back and get a better look. Pretty soon they saw it, for it was coming to meet them. It was wearing black pants, a white shirt, and black suspenders. Sam said, ""I'm going to try to touch it. Then we'll know if it's real."" He walked up to it and peered into its face. It had bright penetrating eyes sunk deep in its head. It looked like a skeleton. Ted took one look and screamed, and again he and Sam ran, but this time the skeleton followed them. When they got to Ted's house, they stood in the doorway and watched it. It stayed out in the road for a while. Then it disappeared. A year later Ted got sick and died. Toward the end, Sam sat up with him every night. The night Ted died, Sam said he looked just like the skeleton."
A farmer had a daughter for whom he cared more than anything on earth. She fell in love with a farmhand,"A farmer had a daughter for whom he cared more than anything on earth. She fell in love with a farmhand named Jim, but the farmer did not think Jim was good enough for his daughter. To keep them apart, he sent her to live with her uncle on the other side of the county. Soon after she left, Jim got sick, and he wasted away and died. Everyone said he died of a broken heart. The farmer felt so guilty about Jim's death, he could not tell his daughter what had happened. She continued to think about Jim and the life they might have had together. One night many weeks later there was a knock on her uncle s door. When the girl opened the door, Jim was standing there. ""Your father asked me to get you,"" he said. ""I came on his best horse."" ""Is there anything wrong?"" she asked. ""I don't know,"" he said. She packed a few things, and they left. She rode behind him, clinging to his waist. Soon he complained of a head- ache. ""It aches something terrible,"" he told her. She put her hand on his forehead. ""Why, you are as cold as clay,"" she said. ""I hope you are not ill,"" and she wrapped her handkerchief around his head. They traveled so swiftly that in a few hours they reached the farm. The girl quickly dismounted and knocked on the door. Her father was startled to see her. ""Didn't you send for me?"" she asked. ""No, I didn't,"" he said. She turned to Jim, but he was gone and so was the horse. They went to the stable to look for them. The horse was there. It was covered with sweat and trembling with fear. But there was no sign of Jim. Terrified, her father told her the truth about Jim's death. Then quickly he went to see Jim's parents. They decided to open his grave. The corpse was in its coffin. But around its head they found the girl's handkerchief."
"The timber wolves around French Creek had gotten out of hand. There were so many wolves, the farmers","The timber wolves around French Creek had gotten out of hand. There were so many wolves, the farmers could not stop them from killing their cattle and sheep. So the state put a bounty on them. It would pay a hunter ten dollars for every wolf pelt he turned in. A butcher in town named Bill Williams thought that was pretty good money. He stopped working as a butcher and started killing wolves. He was good at it. Every year he killed over five hundred of them. That came to more than five thousand dollars. It was quite a bit of money \in those days. After four or five years. Bill had killed so many wolves, there were hardly any left in that area. So he retired, and he vowed never to harm another wolf because wolves had made him rich. Then one day a farmer reported that a white wolf had killed two of his sheep. He had shot at it and hit it, but the bullets didn't have any effect. Soon that wolf was seen all over the countryside, killing and running. But nobody could stop it. One night it came into Bill's yard and killed his pet cow. Bill forgot about his decision never to harm another wolf. He went into town the next morning and bought a young lamb for bait. He took it out into the hills and tied it to a tree. Then he backed off about fifty yards and sat down under another tree. With his gun in his lap, he waited. When Bill didn't come back, his friends started looking for him. Finally they found the lamb. It was still tied to a tree. It was hungry, but it was alive. Then they found Bill. He was still sitting against the other tree, but he was dead. His throat had been torn open. But there was no sign of a struggle. His gun hadn't been fired. And there were no tracks in the soil around him. As for the white wolf, it was never seen again."
One time a preacher went to see if he could put a haunt to rest at a house in his settlement. The house had been haunted,"One time a preacher went to see if he could put a haunt to rest at a house in his settlement. The house had been haunted for about ten years. Several people had tried to stay there all night, but they always would get scared out by the haunt. So this preacher took his Bible and went to the house — went on in, built himself a good fire, and lit a lamp. Sat there reading the Bible. Then just before midnight he heard something start up in the cellar — walking back and forth, back and forth. Then it sounded like somebody was trying to scream and got choked off. Then there was a lot of thrashing around and struggling, and finally everything got quiet. The old preacher took up his Bible again, but before he could start reading, he heard footsteps coming up the cellar stairs. He sat watching the door to the cellar, and the footsteps kept coming closer and closer. He saw the doorknob turn, and when the door began to open, he jumped up and hollered, ""What do you want?"" The door shut back easy-like, and there wasn't a sound. The preacher was trembling a little, but he finally opened the Bible and read awhile. Then he got up and laid the book on the chair and went to mending the fire. Then the haunt started walking again and — step! — step! — step! — up the cellar stairs. The old preacher sat watching the door, saw the doorknob turn and the door open. It looked like a young woman. He backed up and said, ""Who are you? What do you want?"" The haunt sort of swayed like she didn't know what to do — then she just faded out. The old preacher waited, waited, and when he didn't hear any more noises, he went over and shut the door. He was sweating and trem- bling all over, but he was a brave man and he thought he'd be able to see it through. So he turned his chair to where he could watch, and he sat down and waited. It wasn't long before he heard the haunt start up again, slowly — step! — step! — step! — step! — closer, and closer — step! — step! — and it was right at the door. The preacher stood up and held his Bible out before him. Then the knob slowly turned, and the door opened wide. This time the preacher spoke quiet-like. He said, ""In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost — who are you and what do you want?"" The haunt came right across the room, straight to him, and took hold of his coat. It was a young woman about twenty years old. Her hair was torn and tangled, and the flesh was dropping off her face so he could see the bones and part of her teeth. She had no eyeballs, but there was a sort of blue light way back in her eye sockets. And she had no nose to her face. Then she started talking. It sounded like her voice was coming and going with the wind blowing it. She told how her lover had killed her for her money and buried her in the cellar. She said if the preacher would dig up her bones and bury her properly, she could rest. Then she told him to take the end joint of the little finger from her left hand, and to lay it in the collection plate at the next church meeting — and he'd find out who had murdered her. And she said, ""If you come back here once more after that — you'll hear my voice at midnight, and I'll tell you where my money is hid, and you can give it to the church."" The haunt sobbed like she was tired, and she sunk down toward the floor and was gone. The preacher found her bones and buried them in the graveyard. The next Sunday the preacher put the finger bone in the collection plate, and when a certain man happened to touch it, it stuck to his hand. The man jumped up and rubbed and scraped and tore at that bone, trying to get it off. Then he went to screaming, like he was going crazy. Well, he confessed to the murder, and they took him on to jail. After the man was hung, the preacher went back to that house one midnight, and the haunt's voice told him to dig under the hearthrock. He did, and he found a big sack of money. And where that haunt had held on to his coat, the print of those bony fingers was burned right into the cloth. It never did come out."
A young man and his wife were on a trip to visit his mother. Usually they arrived in time for supper. But they had gotten a late start,"A young man and his wife were on a trip to visit his mother. Usually they arrived in time for supper. But they had gotten a late start, and now it was getting dark. So they decided to look for a place to stay overnight and go on in the morning. Just off the road, they saw a small house in the woods. ""Maybe they rent rooms,"" the wife said. So they stopped to ask. An elderly man and woman came to the door. They didn't rent rooms, they said. But they would be glad to have them stay overnight as their guests. They had plenty of room, and they would enjoy the company. The old woman made coffee and brought out some cake, and the four of them talked for a while. Then the young couple were taken to their room. They again ex- plained that they wanted to pay for this, but the old man said he would not accept any money. The young couple got up early the next morning before their hosts had awakened. On a table near the front door, they left an envelope with some money in it for the room. Then they went on to the next town. They stopped in a restaurant and had breakfast. When they told the owner where they had stayed, he was shocked. ""That can't be,"" he said. ""That house burned to the ground, and the man and the woman who lived there died in the fire."" The young couple could not believe it. So they went back to the house. Only now there was no house. All they found was a burned-out shell. They stood staring at the ruins trying to understand what had happened. Then the woman screamed. In the rubble was a badly burned table, like the one they had seen by the front door. On the table was the envelope they had left that morning. They Eat Eyes, They Eat  Nose There are scary stories about all kinds of things. The ones told here are about a grave, a witch, a man who liked to swim, a hunting trip, and a market basket. There also is one about worms eating a corpse — your corpse."
"Some boys and girls were at a party one night. There was a graveyard down the street, and they were talking","Some boys and girls were at a party one night. There was a graveyard down the street, and they were talking about how scary it was. ""Don't ever stand on a grave after dark,"" one of the boys said. ""The person inside will grab you. He'll pull you under."" ""That's not true,"" one of the girls said. ""It's just a superstition."" ""I'll give you a dollar if you stand on a grave,"" said the boy. ""A grave doesn't scare me,"" said the girl. ""I'll do it right now."" The boy handed her his knife. ""Stick this knife in one of the graves,"" he said. ""Then we'll know you were there."" The graveyard was filled with shadows and was as quiet as death. ""There is nothing to be scared of,"" the girl told herself, but she was scared anyway. She picked out a grave and stood on it. Then quickly she bent over and plunged the knife into the soil, and she started to leave. But she couldn't get away. Something was holding her back! She tried a second time to leave, but she couldn't move. She was filled with terror. “Something has got me!"" she screamed, and she fell to the ground. When she didn't come back, the others went to look for her. They found her body sprawled across the grave. Without realizing it, she had plunged the knife through her skirt and had pinned it to the ground. It was only the knife that held her. She had died of fright."
"Two farmhands shared a room. One slept at the back of the room. The other slept near the door. After a while, the one who ","Two farmhands shared a room. One slept at the back of the room. The other slept near the door. After a while, the one who slept near the door began to feel very tired early in the day. His friend asked what was wrong. “An awful thing happens every night/' he said. “A witch turns me into a horse and rides me all over the countryside."" “I'll sleep in your bed tonight,"" his friend said. “We'll see what happens to me."" About midnight an old woman who lived nearby came into the room. She mumbled some strange words over the farmhand, and he found he couldn't move. Then she slipped a bridle on him, and he turned into a horse. The next thing he knew, she was riding him across the fields at breakneck speed, beating him to make him go even faster. Soon they came to a house where a party was going on. There was a lot of music and dancing. They were having a big time inside. She hitched him to a fence and went in. While she was gone, the farmhand rubbed against the fence until the bridle came off, and he turned back into a human being. Then he went into the house and found the witch. He spoke those strange words over her, and with the bridle he turned her into a horse. Then he rode her to a blacksmith and had her fitted with horseshoes. After that, he rode her to the farm where she lived. ""I have a pretty good filly here,” he told her husband, “but I need a stronger horse. Would you like to trade?"" The old man looked her over, and he said he would do it. So they picked out another horse, and the farmhand rode away. Her husband led his new horse to the barn. He took off the bridle and went to hang it up. But when he came back, the new horse was gone. Instead, there stood his wife with horseshoes nailed to her hands and feet."
"A young woman in town married a man from another part of the country. He was a nice fellow, and they got along pretty","A young woman in town married a man from another part of the country. He was a nice fellow, and they got along pretty well together. There was only one problem. Every night he'd go swimming in the river. Sometimes he would be gone all night long, and she would complain about how lonely she was. This couple had two young sons. As soon as the boys could walk, their father began to teach them how to swim. And when they got to be old enough, he took them swimming in the river at night. Often they would stay there all night long, and the young woman would stay home all by herself. After a while, she began to act in a strange way — at least, that is what the neighbors said. She told them that her husband was turning into an alligator, and that he was trying to turn the boys into alligators. Everybody told her there was nothing wrong with a man taking his sons swimming. That was a natural thing to do. And when it came to alligators, there just weren't any nearby. Everybody knew that. Early one morning the young woman came running into town from the direction of the river. She was soaking wet. She said a big alligator and two little alligators had pulled her in and had tried to get her to eat a raw fish. They were her husband and her sons, she said, and they wanted her to live with them. But she had gotten away. Her doctor decided she had lost her mind, and he had her put in the hospital for a while. After that nobody saw her husband and boys again. They just disappeared. But now and then a fisherman would tell about seeing alligators in the river at night. Usually it was one big alligator and two small ones. But people said they were just making it up. Everybody knows there aren't any alligators around here."

He stayed with friends in the big house they owned outside the city. That night they had a good time visiting. But when Blackwell went to bed, he tossed and turned and couldn't sleep. Sometime during the night he heard a car turn into the driveway. He went to the window to see who was arriving at such a late hour. In the moonlight, he saw a long, black hearse filled with people. The driver of the hearse looked up at him. When Black- well saw his queer, hideous face, he shuddered. The driver called to him, “There is room for one more."" Then he waited for a minute or two, and he drove off. In the morning Blackwell told his friends what had happened. “You were dreaming,"" they said. ""I must have been,"" he said, “but it didn't seem like a dream.""  After breakfast he went into Philadelphia. He spent the day high above the city in one of the new office buildings there. Late in the afternoon he was waiting for an elevator to take him back down to the street. But when it arrived, it was very crowded. One of the passengers looked out and called to him. “There is room for one more,"" he said. It was the driver of the hearse. “No, thanks,"" said Blackwell. ""I'll get the next one."" The doors closed, and the elevator started down. There was shrieking and screaming, then the sound of a crash. The elevator had fallen to the bottom of the shaft. Every-one aboard was killed."
A young boy lay sleeping in his bed when he heard footsteps outside his room. He peeked out of his eyes to see ,"A young boy lay sleeping in his bed when he heard footsteps outside his room. He peeked out of his eyes to see what was happening when his door swung open to reveal a murderer carrying corpses of his parents. After silently propping them up on a chair, he wrote something on the wall in the blood of the dead bodies. He then hid under the child’s bed. The child got scared beyond belief. He couldn’t read the writing on the wall and he knew the man was under his bed. Like any child, he pretended that he slept through the whole thing and hadn’t woken up yet. He lay still as the bodies, quietly hearing the breathes from under his bed. An hour passed, and his eyes got adjusted to the darkness. He tried making out the words, but it was a struggle. He gasped when he finally read out the sentence. ‘I know you’re awake’ he read as he felt something shift underneath his bed."
"I got my first pair of glasses last week. My parents didn’t think I needed them at first, but the doctor said that there was something wrong ","I got my first pair of glasses last week. My parents didn’t think I needed them at first, but the doctor said that there was something wrong with more than just my eyes that was apparently pretty common, and that I needed specially prescribed glasses “for my own good”. He said that many people were never given the chance to see the way I would, so I was lucky to get them. I thought he meant cars and faraway words would become less blurry, but over the span of a couple of days, many more things have become more clear. I started seeing nightmare creatures. All around. I’d never seen them there before, like in the corners of my room and in darkened parking lots. I took my glasses off for the first time today. And let me just say it’s amazing how quickly demons and creatures turn into trees and shadows. I know I’m not seeing the truth. But I’m a simple person. I’d rather things remain blurry, just the way it is for everyone else."
Keith was 12 the first time the old man in the well spoke to him. Keith was out playing after dark on the family’s small farm near the well,"Keith was 12 the first time the old man in the well spoke to him. Keith was out playing after dark on the family’s small farm near the well. The old well had beams supporting a rope and pulley with a bucket attached, even though Keith was told that well ran dry before he was born. Suddenly he heard someone say his name in a slow raspy voice. Keith whirled around and saw no one. A look of confusion spread across his face as he heard it again. “Keith!” This time, it was said with more force and a bit louder. The voice sounded like one of the old farmers who liked to smoke, thought Keith. Looking down the well, Keith heard the same voice asking, “Have you got anything tasty?”. Keith couldn’t see anything past the first 12 or so feet down the well, even though it was a full moon. “Who are you? How’d you get down there?”, Keith asked. “If you give me something tasty, I’ll reward you”, replied the voice. All Keith had were some cookies he had stuffed in his pocket as he left to play. He put those in the bucket and it lowered it. He had lowered it nearly 40 feet and was literally at the end of his rope when he no longer felt the weight of the bucket on the rope. 20 seconds passed and he felt the weight of the bucket again and began to pull the bucket up. As he finished the pulling the bucket up to the top he heard the voice say, “No nice.” Keith saw a reflection in the bucket and saw a rectangular piece of silver metal, about the size of an army dog tag. It was completely flat and smooth. “Want fresh!” the voice said. Even though Keith tried to talk to the old man again there was no response. Keith made up a story about where he found the metal and took it to his father who took it into town and confirmed it was an ounce of pure silver. After that, Keith kept it a secret. It took a while to discover that the old man was only there the night of full moons. Keith quickly learned that only live things he put in the well would be rewarded, but only once for each item and once every full moon. So one of each kind of animal was lowered down the well and rewarded. Keith now had a cigar box mostly full of silver pieces by the time he was 16, but had run out of different animals to get rewarded for. It was around this time that a local farmhand went missing. It was also the same time that Keith was rewarded with gold pieces for the first time. Once Keith took over the farm, temp workers seemed to vanish every now and then without explanation from the farm. The old man had finally found something tasty enough to always reward."

I had a good view from my window to see the new neighbors move in next door early in the morning. There was a man and woman carrying boxes into the house, they must’ve been a couple. My eyes travelled to the neighbors’ vacant, upstairs bedroom window which was directly across from mine. It was open, and inside was a girl who looked about my age. She saw me, and motioned for me to open my window, so I did. She leaned out the window, curved her hand around her mouth and whispered to me, “Nice to meet you, I’m Sarah.” I laughed, “Nice to meet you Sarah, I’m Sam.” She smiled, “Keep your window open” she said, and moved out of sight. I was confused, “Keep my window open?” She returned with something in her hand, then tossed it over to me, it was a paper airplane. It slowly and gently made its way through my window, onto my floor behind me. I walked over and picked it up. On top was written “Open”. I opened it and there was a message “Hey Sam, I’ll come over tonight and introduce myself!” I thought it was a bit strange and wrote back “Come over tonight? What do you mean?” I turned around to toss it back but, she wasn’t there. The window was still open so I tossed it in anyway, thinking she’ll reply sooner or later. It was late into the evening, and still no reply from Sarah. My mom invited the new neighbors over for dinner, I figured this is what Sarah meant by coming over tonight. “Honey come down for dinner!” my mom shouted. I went downstairs into the dining room to sit at the table but, I didn’t see Sarah, just her parents. I couldn’t help but ask, “Where’s Sarah?” The man and woman stared at me as if I said something out of place, “Excuse me?” the man said. I repeated myself, “Sarah, your daughter?” The woman put her hands up covering her mouth, tears flowed down her face. The man stood, “Our daughter died a year ago in an accident. I don’t know what you’re up to, but that’s enough.” They both left the house immediately, mom glared at me, “Why would you do that son? Just go to your room!” A flurry of confusion was spinning in my head, I couldn’t speak. I made my way back to my room, turned on my light and lay on my bed. Then a paper airplane flew through my window, elegantly landing on my floor. I picked it up and looked out my window. Sarah was standing in the darkness of her room. My heart was pounding. She moved closer until the moonlight hither face, her eyes dark, and skin grey. I looked down to read the message. “Behind you.” My lights flickered off, the floorboards behind me squeaked, a dark whisper into my ear, “Sam”."
"She was the prettiest girl in the class, but of course she never heard that from me. I was obsessed with her. I’d steal glances at her every chance","She was the prettiest girl in the class, but of course she never heard that from me. I was obsessed with her. I’d steal glances at her every chance I got. During class when I was supposed to be taking notes, on the train we rode after school. But today I wanted to do more. I hopped off the train when she got off and followed her out of the station and onto the sidewalk. I made sure to keep my distance. I wanted to surprise her. It was pretty hard staying within a good distance of her, though. She kept taking furtive glances back, and I looked down at my phone or pretended to tie my shoe every time she would. When she unlocked the door and stepped inside her house, I crept to the front stairs. My heart pounded as I rang the doorbell. A chime sounded from inside and awoke the butterflies in my stomach. Just as I reached again for the doorbell, she opened the door ajar and, recognizing my face, gestured for me to hurry in, promptly closing the door behind me. “There was a guy,” she paused, “There was a guy following…” “Yeah, it was me.” The words came out of my mouth before I realized what I had said. “I know that,” I sighed in relief “But I’m talking about the man behind you.” The doorbell chimed, and the butterflies in my stomach stood still this time."
"No one believed me when I told them that my reflection in the mirror was alive. “Grow up, dude, you’re not a 5 years","No one believed me when I told them that my reflection in the mirror was alive. “Grow up, dude, you’re not a 5 years old. You’re 24!” That was all they said to me while laughing, as a response to my story. Well, I had to admit, it was indeed sounded like a typical fear a 5 years old would have. But I swear to God, it was true! I couldn’t remember since when my reflection came to life, but I remembered that it wasn’t like that when I was a child. It was recently, I was sure. And it wasn’t a ghost. Well, your reflection was alive looked like an act of a ghostly thing, but no, mine wasn’t a ghost. It felt to me as if it was a creature… An entity, who lived behind the mirror. Or trapped in there. I couldn’t tell why or how. What I could tell was my reflection was constantly trying to grab me, as if it was going to pull me inside the mirror while jumped out. Nope! That wasn’t gonna happen. Ever. Ever since I realized that my reflection was alive and constantly trying to grab me inside the mirror, I always did my best to kept my distance from reflective surfaces. Like, when I brushed my teeth every night, for example. I always stood a few meters from the mirror, so it wouldn’t be able to grab me. The entity in the mirror was constantly showing a grumpy and angry face every time it was just the two of us in the room. No matter how I try to smile in front of the mirror, the entity behind it never smiled. Never. It always looked grumpy and angry. One day, I took off from my flat for a sightseeing in the mall nearby, when suddenly an earthquake occurred. It was a huge one. Everyone was hysterical. They were running around in panic, looking for a shelter. I ran to cover myself under a table to avoid getting hit by anything that fell. But I was too late. I didn’t realize something fell from above me and hit me in the head. I fell down and I groaned from the pain. As the pain slowly faded, I started looked around. The earthquake had stopped. The mall was slightly dark. The light was out. It was messy in there. I gasped when I noticed something shiny not far from me. I turned my head and I saw a mirror. Probably from the fitting room near me. In reflexed, I crawled away as far as I could, even though my head and my legs were hurt. Right there and then, I saw my reflection in the mirror. For the first time in forever, I saw the entity behind the mirror smiling at me. A devilish smile. A sense of horror grasped me as I saw the entity waving at me from behind the mirror, as if it was saying goodbye. For good."
"For as long as I can remember, the house at the end of the street held some mystery. Uninhabited for years","For as long as I can remember, the house at the end of the street held some mystery. Uninhabited for years, the local kids and parents all knew about its previous occupants and what happened. A young couple moved into the place around 2004. The young wife was upstairs one day when the husband rang the doorbell for some assistance carrying some boxes inside the front door. His wife said, “Coming” but then proceeded to take a tumble down the staircase and broke her neck upon hitting the front door which was at the base of the stairs, dying instantly. The noise alarmed the husband who dropped the boxes and the rest is history. The husband was heartbroken and never spent another night there, leaving some things behind inside the house. As with all juicy tales there were follow up stories, and this is where things got weird. Apparently one day a UPS worker walked up the house, mistaking it for the house next door, rang the doorbell to deliver a package and heard someone say “Coming” then a moment later something hit the door hard. It was late in the afternoon, no lights were on, and dead silence. This alarmed the man, but after asking “Is anyone there?” a few times he realized he was at the wrong address and made the correction. He told the neighbor, the real recipient of the package, about what had happened and was genuinely shocked when he learned that nobody actually lived there anymore. The neighbor said his pallor went from a natural hue to pure white terror. This just added to the legend. Around Halloween each year we would have these contests to see who could ring the doorbell, stand there for 2 minutes without getting scared or running away. Nobody ever did it, well not until Casey moved into the neighborhood. His father was in the Navy and Casey was fearless; all the kids looked up to him. When Casey celebrated hisfirst Halloween with us he accepted the challenge. We watched from across the street. Hell, we were scared. Casey walked up the house, rang the doorbell. Nothing happened, but then he reached for the doorknob and walked in, surprising all of us. “Is he fucking crazy, dude?” I shouted. Casey was now inside the weirdo house, it was dark but we could see him with his flashlight in the rooms on the second floor. The rest of us looked at each other and said, “Fuck it” and ran across the street to join Casey. We get to the house and right as we opened the door Casey comes tumbling down the stairs and would have hit the door if we weren’t standing there holding it open. We picked him up and said, “What the hell happened?” “I rang the bell, someone said ‘Come in’ so I did” he replied. “But you fell.” “Something pushed me, but nobody was up there at all, not a soul.”"
The decorations I put up on the Christmas tree are truly beautiful. No exaggeration; they’re really nice. The ornaments ,"The decorations I put up on the Christmas tree are truly beautiful. No exaggeration; they’re really nice. The ornaments are different & unique, with their own colors and unique designs. Not to mention the tinsel wrapped around the tree is shiny and colorful. I realize something special is missing. Ah, yes, it’s the star! I go and leave the living room for a second before coming back with the star. With the help of a stool, I managed to get it on the tree. After that, I take a step back to admire the decorations I placed on the tree. They’re magnificent, extravagant, and amazing. However, the only downside to these beautiful decorations is that I always have to replace them with new ones. It’s tiring sometimes, but I guess th…. Thud My train of thought is suddenly interrupted. Looking down, I gasp as I see the star has fallen off the tree! I picked it up, ignoring the small droplets of blood falling onto my carpet. Then I placed the star back on the tree, with the same stool as my support. I breathed a sigh of relief. Thank goodness I was able to react quickly to pick it up, or else it would have been ruined! Taking one last look at the beautiful decorations placed on my Christmas tree, I smile happily before going into the kitchen to make some hot chocolate. My Christmas decorations are beautiful, yes. But it’s unfortunate that I always have to replace them with new ones every year. It’s always hard to find them, but the hunt is always worth it in the end."
"I bought a new house in the small town of Winthrop. The house was cheap, but the most important part","I bought a new house in the small town of Winthrop. The house was cheap, but the most important part was that I needed to get away from the city. A few months ago, I had a run-in with a stalker. While I had managed to get him arrested, I couldn’t shake the feeling of eyes just constantly watching me. I felt like there were eyes everywhere, at home and on the street, so I decided to move out into the country to somewhere with fewer people, just for peace of mind. The house itself was big and somewhat old, but otherwise very welcoming. The agent who introduced me to the house had been required to mention that a serial killer had lived here in the past, which was why the house was so cheap. However, he, and later, my next-door neighbor Sarah, both told me to pay the thought no mind. Four other owners had lived in the house since then, and all of them were very happy with it. I loved the house. Its interior furnishings were beautiful and very comfortable. The people of Winthrop were friendly, often bringing over freshly baked pastries or inviting me over for dinner. “Get-togethers,” they said, “were the key to making sure everyone who lived in Winthrop loved it there.”Yet after a week, I stopped “loving it.” The feeling of someone watching returned, worse than before. I tried to ignore it, but soon I started losing sleep. Giant bags grew under my eyes and I began yawning almost as much as I breathed. Sarah was kind enough to let me stay in her house for a few nights. It was during this time that I heard the legend of Forrest Carter, the serial killer who had lived in my house. While no one knows his exact kill count, Carter, also known as the Winthrop Peacock, was a man with an extremely severe case of narcissism. Legends say that he couldn’t fall asleep if he didn’t feel like he was being watched. He was finally arrested for putting up a scarecrow to watch him during the night. Only it wasn’t a scarecrow. Carter had murdered a 17-year-old girl, just so her corpse could stare at him. The story gave me shivers, and after I went home, I felt like there were hundreds of pairs of eyes just watching me no matter how I turned. Today, however, was the first day that I acted out. I was cooking breakfast when I felt the eyes. Instinctively, out of fear, I threw my kitchen knife, which lodged itself into the wall. As I pulled it out, I found myself staring at a pair of eyes, pickling in formaldehyde. I’ve been watching the police peel away the drywall of my house for hours now. So far, they’ve found 142 pairs of eyes in little glass jars. The scariest thing is, everyone was staring at me."
"Cradling my four-year-old daughter in my arms, all I could do was listen as the screaming outside the house got louder and louder, interspersed","Cradling my four-year-old daughter in my arms, all I could do was listen as the screaming outside the house got louder and louder, interspersed with sounds of violence and horrible, horrible wet thuds and the unmistakable echo of muscle and sinew resisting the force that was slowly tearing them apart. It started just three days ago. Something happened, out there in the world, and before we even get news of what’s going on, seemingly half of the world is gone. Police and military were unable to stop it, providing such a short frame of resistance it’s hard to know whether it was real or just a fluke. There was no centralised target, no way to use our most powerful weapons, not without incinerating ourselves in the process. They poured forth across the world, from wherever it was that it started.I hear banging on the door downstairs, and the screams of people being slaughtered, unable to mount a proper resistance against such a force. It doesn’t take long before the pounding gives way to splintering and the sound of shattering wood. They’re in the house. No more than a moment or two passes before the door to the bedroom starts shuddering. The things I piled against it are holding, for now, but I know, realistically, that they’re going to manage to come through.I keep rocking my little girl, humming a lullaby in her ear to calm her as she cries. The pounding grows in force and volume, and the frame starts to crack. I put my little girl on my lap, her back to my chest, and I stroke her head with both hands, from the top of her scalp, down across her ears, just as I’ve done ever since she was a baby. Just the way she loves it. The effect is instantaneous. Her desperate crying calms to a series of sobs and hiccoughs, her small body shuddering against mine in fear. I keep humming to her, soothing her hair, acting for all the world as if nothing is out of place, not a single thing amiss. Agonisingly slowly, in a reverse cadence of the sound of splintering wood, she calms down. I can feel it when she stops tensing, as I keep stroking her down the sides of her head. A final hiccough of a sob, and she falls quiet, her body relaxed. She doesn’t even have time to realise what’s happening as I twist her neck with a violent jerk, accompanied by a dry snap of a sound. She’s dead before she can even slump down into my lap. The door is giving way, the furniture is pushed back. I may be torn limb from limb while I scream, but at least my baby angel’s safe from harm."
"I flung myself through the door and vaulted the toppled, long-dead refrigerator that served as an ineffective barricade","I flung myself through the door and vaulted the toppled, long-dead refrigerator that served as an ineffective barricade in front of me. My legs propelled me through the room and into the small hallway on the other side. I couldn’t stop eating the expired contents of the fridge, appealing to me despite their stench after several days without food. The shrieks of pain and cries for mercy around me spurred my body onward and filled me with unexpected energy in spite of my hunger. We were at war. I came to a halt in front of a small bathroom. A noise. Something behind the shower curtain. My fear heightened and images of the enemy flooded my mind. Merciless beasts wearing human skin, devouring indiscriminately, accepting no pleas, and respecting no argument. Zombies. It had begun as we expected, with a virus. The original infected was almost a cliché. There was no humanity left in them. Just mindless rage, twisted bodies, and some primal urge to consume others. Our generation had prepared, with almost obsessive focus, for this monster. The first wave was eradicated with almost laughable ease. We were not prepared for adaptation. We were not prepared for the creature we bred by destroying the instantly recognizable zombie. A creature with more tact. Most of the first zombies were killed at close range, you understand since longer-range attacks were less likely to be fatal. We had trained ourselves, even before the outbreak, to equate “infection” with “death” when it came to zombies. A person “died” when their eyes clouded over and they started biting, not when you put a bullet in their head. The new strain of the virus still controlled the body, yes, but it left other faculties to the host. Maybe you could pull the trigger on a hopelessly crazed caricature of your best friend, your spouse, or your child. But what if there was still a soul behind those eyes? If even as they attacked, they sobbed and screamed in their voice? All the virus needed was a moment’s hesitation. I bet you’d hesitate. I did. This is why now I could only watch as my arm wrenched back the shower curtain and my hands reached for the cowering child. Why I could only beg for forgiveness before the virus used my mouth to tear ragged, bloody hunks from his body. Why I couldn’t even vomit as my hunger dissipated with the now sickeningly familiar taste of human flesh. We were at war. And I am the enemy."

They turn lights on in every room as if it’s some sort of security blanket. And if you ever force them to turn them off, they cry and scream and eventually you give in. The only time they turn them off is with their parents. They feel safe. So very safe. I’m the “monster” that lives in your closet. I’m friends with the one under your bed and the one in the shadows. When you see us, you flee to you’re mommy and daddy. But we’re not here to hurt you. We’re here to protect you. If you think we’re scary, just wait till you see their true form. They masquerade as one of you and you can never tell. You humans must be blind. Your true monsters sleep just down the hall. They pretend to love you but It won’t last. They try to convince us to let them in but don’t worry, we really love you and we will protect you. So when you see a shadow flit or a figure in the closet, remember, we scary monsters protect you from the human ones. So you’re safe with us… For now."
I rarely sleep alone. Not that I have a choice in the matter. The night always starts and for that matter always,"I rarely sleep alone. Not that I have a choice in the matter. The night always starts and for that matter always ends the same. Knock back a few sleeping pills, take off my socks and let myself get drowsy. Couldn’t tell you why I even take them still, the pills that is. I’m a creature of habit you could say. Then again so is she. I guess you could also say we’re inseparable, not that I planned it that way, that’s just how it is now. Every night I wait and every night her face appears. No matter how badly I clog myself with prescription pills I can feel her arrival. Sometimes she’s just a face, sometimes just a jaggedly rearranged torso. I couldn’t tell you what’s worse; her wide eyed contorted look of hatred or that delirious look of malignant joy spattered across it’s twisted face. It paces too. Or it glides like it’s on a conveyor belt back and forth. Her eyes never leaving mine. Eyes wild with rage. The nights when the body of the thing lays itself beside me, to find us face to face with her lips agape, as if she was mimicking my horrified reaction is beyond description. My whole body becomes liquefied with fear and I bolt upright to escape but never make it past my bedroom door. My legs fail me and I’m suddenly a heap by my dresser drawer. That’s when she kneels, purses her fat purple lips and utters the only words I’ve ever heard her say since that night. “You shouldn’t have killed me.”"

My parents constantly try to explain to me how sick he is. I am lucky to have a brain where all the chemicals flow properly to their destinations like undammed rivers. When I complain about how bored I am without a little brother to play with, they try to make me feel bad by pointing out that his boredom likely far surpasses mine, considering his confinement to a dark room in an institution. I always beg for them to give him one last chance. Of course, they did at first. Charlie has been back home several times, each shorter in duration than the last. Every time without fail, it all starts again. The neighborhood cats with gouged-out eyes showing up in his toy chest, my dad’s razors found dropped on the baby slide in the park across the street, mom’s vitamins replaced by bits of dishwasher tablets. My parents are hesitant now, using “last chances” sparingly. They say his disorder makes him charming, makes it easy for him to fake normalcy, and trick the doctors who care for him into thinking he is ready for rehabilitation. That I will just have to put up with my boredom if it means staying safe from him. I hate it when Charlie has to go away. It makes me have to pretend to be good until he is back."

It was an ordinary grey plastic wristwatch in every respect except for the fact that it was counting down. “That is all of the time you have left in the world, son. Use it wisely.” And indeed he did. As the watch ticked away, the boy, now a man, lived life to the fullest. He climbed mountains and swam oceans. He talked and laughed and lived and loved. The man was never afraid, for he knew exactly how much time he had left. Eventually, the watch began its final countdown. The old man stood looking over everything he had done, everything he had built. 5. He shook hands with his old business partner, the man who had long been his friend and confidant. 4. His dog came and licked his hand, earning a pat on the head for its companionship. 3. He hugged his son, knowing that he had been a good father. 2. He kissed his wife on the forehead one last time. 1. The old man smiled and closed his eyes. Then, nothing happened. The watch beeped once and turned off. The man stood standing there, very much alive. You would think that at that moment he would have been overjoyed. Instead, for the first time in his life, the man was scared."

We loved exploring its dusty ","When my sister Betsy and I were kids, our family lived for a while in a charming old farmhouse. We loved exploring its dusty corners and climbing the apple tree in the backyard. But our favorite thing was the ghost. We called her Mother because she seemed so kind and nurturing. Some mornings Betsy and I would wake up, and on each of our nightstands, we’d find a cup that hadn’t been there the night before. Mother had left them there, worried that we’d get thirsty during the night. She just wanted to take care of us. Among the house’s original furnishings was an antique wooden chair, which we kept against the back wall of the living room. Whenever we were preoccupied, watching TV or playing a game, Mother would inch that chair forward, across the room, toward us. Sometimes she’d manage to move it to the center of the room. We always felt sad putting it back against the wall. Mother just wanted to be near us. Years later, long after we’d moved out, I found an old newspaper article about the farmhouse’s original occupant, a widow. She’d murdered her two children by giving them each a cup of poisoned milk before bed. Then she’d hanged herself. The article included a photo of the farmhouse’s living room, with a woman’s body hanging from a beam. Beneath her, knocked over, was that old wooden chair, placed exactly in the center of the room."
"Have you ever walked into a room and found a vampire? No, not the sexy kind, but a foul creature with bony limbs","Have you ever walked into a room and found a vampire? No, not the sexy kind, but a foul creature with bony limbs and ashen skin? The kind that snarls as you enter, like a beast about to pounce? The kind that roots you to the spot with its sunken, hypnotic eyes, rendering you unable to flee as you watch the hideous thing uncoil from the shadows? Has your heart started racing though your legs refuse to? Have you felt time slow as the creature crosses the room in the darkness of a blink? Have you shuddered with fear when it places one clawed hand atop your head and another under your chin so it can tilt you, exposing your neck? Have you squirmed as its rough, dry tongue slides down your cheek, over your jaw, to your throat, in a slithering search that’s seeking your artery? Have you felt its hot breath release in a hiss against your skin when it probes your pulse—the flow that leads to your brain? Has its tongue rested there, throbbing slightly as if savoring the moment? Have you then experienced a sinking, sucking blackness as you discover that not all vampires feed on blood—some feed on memories? Well, have you?Maybe not. But let me rephrase the question: Have you ever walked into a room and suddenly forgotten why you came in?"

A psychologist can help…”. “I don’t need therapy. I need answers. They seem to have a life all their own. I can’t hold a job. I’m under investigation for assault. I almost killed my neighbor. This can’t go on. I’ll try anything at this point.” After two weeks on a new medication, Adam saw no progress and grew increasingly depressed. He was convinced that despite what the doctors said, it was not a psychological problem. That night, a frustrated and angry Adam sat in a chair and drank bourbon. Drunk and hopeless, he stumbled to the garage and started the table saw, then slowly lowered his wrists toward the screaming blade. Detective Armstrong entered the garage where several uniformed officers stood over the blood-soaked body. “So what do we get?” he asked, taking in the blood-splattered scene.”This is a weird one, Detective.” “How so?” “Take a look at the body. He apparently chopped off his hands with the table saw and bled to death.” Armstrong knelt. “And?” “And we can’t find his hands anywhere.”"

We connected online, decided on a quiet place, and now we’re all sitting cross-legged in a circle. Real Kumbaya crap. Jerome takes the lead, pouring everyone a cup of tea as he starts talking.”I’m Jerome. You can drink your tea, but only after explaining why you’re here.

Next to talk are a legless veteran, a broke businessman, a needle-tracked junkie, and a diseased old crone. Then it’s my turn.”I’m an ass. Everyone hates me.”I take a loud, annoying slurp of oolong as the fat kid with a black eye goes next, telling his boring fat-kid sob story.Afterward, we’re all sitting quietly when Jerome keels over.

"People started falling from the sky by the close of the decade. They were never clothed, always naked, always a petrifying","People started falling from the sky by the close of the decade. They were never clothed, always naked, always a petrifying grin on their faces. It had been just a few at first, but then hundreds and thousands would fall at a time, destroying cars, and homes, and blocking off highways. Strange discoveries were made upon research; they were human but lacked any blood, intestines, or even a heart. No one could explain the hideous grins they had, or even where they came from. It was a woman in Costa Rica who made the latest and most disturbing discovery. She recognized one of the fallen bodies as a long-dead relative, one who died back when she was a teenager. Then more and more identifications were made. Soon people were picking out their long dead loved ones amongst the video feeds, cadaver piles, and crematoriums. No one could explain why they were coming back, falling from the sky. Even more distressing, after disposing of the bodies, it wouldn’t be long until that same body came plummeting from the sky again. You could not get rid of them, no matter what. People were getting killed by the higher volume of falling bodies, and soon after burial, they too, began to fall. My mother was killed when a body landed on her car, crushing her. The next week, the news reported on a body that had gotten lodged in an airplane windshield. I saw my mother’s grinning face, the happiest I had ever seen her. They say when hell is full; the dead shall walk the earth. What about heaven?"

They hastily","He awoke to the huge, insect like creatures looming over his bed and screamed his lungs out. They hastily left the room and he stayed up all night, shaking and wondering if it had been a dream. The next morning, there was a tap on the door. Gathering his courage, he opened it to see one of them gently place a plate filled with fried breakfast on the floor, then retreat to a safe distance. Bewildered, he accepted the gift. The creatures chittered excitedly. This happened every day for weeks. At first, he was worried they were fattening him up, but after a particularly greasy breakfast left him clutching his chest from heartburn, they were replaced with fresh fruit. As well as cooking, they poured hot steamy baths for him and even tucked him in when he went to bed. It was bizarre. One night, he awoke to gunshots and screaming. He raced downstairs to find a decapitated burglar being devoured by the insects. He was sickened, but disposed of the remains as best he could. He knew they had just been protecting him. One morning the creatures wouldn’t let him leave his room. He lay down, confused but trusting as they ushered him back into bed. Whatever their motives, they weren’t going to hurt him. Hours later a burning pain spread throughout his body. It felt like his stomach was filled with razor wire. The insects chittered as he spasmed and moaned. It was only when he felt a terrible squirming feeling beneath his skin that he realised the insects hadn’t been protecting him. They had been protecting their young."
"Everyone loves the first day of school, right? New year, new classes, new friends. It’s a day full of potential","Everyone loves the first day of school, right? New year, new classes, new friends. It’s a day full of potential and hope before all the dreary depressions of reality show up to ruin all the fun. I like the first day of school for a different reason, though. You see, I have a sort of power. When I look at people, I can…sense a sort of aura around them. A colored outline is based on how long that person has to live. Most everyone I meet around my age is surrounded by a solid green hue, which means they have plenty of time left. A fair amount of them have a yellow-orangish tinge to their auras, which tends to mean a car crash or some other tragedy. Anything that takes people “before their time” as they say. The real fun is when the auras venture into the red end of the spectrum, though. Now and again I’ll see someone who’s a walking stoplight. Those are the ones who get murdered or kill themselves. It’s such a rush to see them and know their time is numbered. With that in mind, I always get to class very early so I can scout out my classmates’ fates. The first kid who walked in was radiating red. I chuckled to myself. Too damn bad, bro. But as people kept walking in, they all had the same intense glow. I finally caught a glimpse of my rose-tinted reflection in the window, but I was too stunned to move. Our professor stepped in and locked the door, his aura a sickening shade of green."
It has been said that the definition of insanity is “doing the same thing over and over and expecting,"It has been said that the definition of insanity is “doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results”. I understand the sentiment behind the saying, but it’s wrong. I entered the building on a bet. I was strapped for cash and didn’t buy into the old legends of the hotel to begin with, so fifty bucks was more than enough to get me to do it. It was simple. Just reach the top floor, the 45th floor, and shine my flashlight from a window. The hotel was old and broken, including the elevator, so that meant hiking up the stairs. So up the stairs, I went. As I reached each platform, I noted the old brass plaques displaying the floor numbers. 15, 16, 17, 18. I felt a little tired as I crept higher, but so far, no ghosts, no cannibals, no demons. Piece of cake. I can’t tell you how happy I was as I entered that last stretch of numbers. I joyfully counted them aloud at each platform. 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 44. I stopped and looked back down the stairs. I must have miscounted, so I continued up. 44. One more flight. 44. And then down ten flights. 44. Fifteen flights. 44. And so it’s been for as long as I can remember. So really, insanity isn’t doing something repeatedly and expecting different results. It’s knowing that the results will never ever change; that each door leads to the same staircase, to the same number. It’s realizing you no longer fall asleep. It’s not knowing whether you’ve been running for days or weeks or years. It’s when the sobbing slowly turns into laughter."

Not in the old house. Not in the barn. I run into the empty field, my heart racing. As I scan the area, I run into a mound of dirt and trip, sprawling to the ground. Getting up, it hits me. Abandoned farm. I tripped over freshly tilled earth. Crouching down, I start frantically clawing with my hands. Scooping handfuls of dirt, I hit something hard. Wood.”Are you in there?!” I cry, pressing my ear to the wood. I hear muffled cries. I start digging again but realize it’s taking too long. Looking around, I see a garden shed. I sprint to it, ripping the door open. I see a shovel, still caked in dirt. Probably the same one that bastard buried her with. I grab it. Running back, I started digging with purpose. Soon the wooden box is exposed. I toss the shovel and rip open the crate. She stares back at me, eyes wide. Bound. Gagged. But alive. I sigh with relief. Thank God. I reach into my bag, pulling out my rag and chloroform. I crouch down, placing it over her face. She struggles, and faints. I toss her over my shoulder.”Ah, hell!” My brother says as I walk back to the truck with a smirk. “You found her!” “Yup. You almost had me though!” I laugh.”All right. My turn. Where did you put her?”I gesture to the creek area. “Somewhere over there. Drowning’s an issue though.” “Jerk!” he says, running off. I smile, watching him go. I love Adult Hide and Seek."

He hadn’t moved for over an hour. The accident earlier that evening kept playing over and over in his mind. The light turned red, but he was in a hurry and accelerated. An orange blur came from his right, and in a split second there was a violent jolt, then the bicyclist rolled across his hood and fell out of sight on the pavement. Horns blared angrily and he panicked, stepping on the gas and screeching away from the chaos into the darkness, shaken and keeping an eye on his rearview mirror until he got home. Why did you run, you idiot? He’d never committed a crime before this and punished himself by imagining years in jail, his career gone, his family gone, his future gone. Why not just go to the police right now? You can afford a lawyer. Then someone tapped on the front door and his world suddenly crumbled away beneath him. They found me. There was nothing he could do but answer it. Running would only make matters worse. His body trembling, he got up, went to the door, and opened it. A police officer stood under the porch light.” Mr. Halverson?” asked the grim officer. He let out a defeated sigh. “Yes. Let me —”I am sorry, but I’m afraid I have some bad news. Your son’s bike was struck by a hit-and-run driver this evening. He died at the scene. I’m very sorry for your loss.”"
"I don’t want to sound mean, but the dead are pretty clueless. I’ve always seen them. When I was younger everyone ","I don’t want to sound mean, but the dead are pretty clueless. I’ve always seen them. When I was younger everyone thought I was just talking to imaginary friends. After a couple of years, when I overheard my parents talk about calling a psychologist, I realised what I was talking to. See, ghosts don’t tend to realise they’re dead, and they don’t look like in the movies, they look just like us. I’m pretty smart for a 13-year-old, so I started noticing certain patterns to tell them apart from the living. They could be a bit distant from living people, or you’d see them try to talk to people who wouldn’t even notice them. Some of them could tell I was different, that I noticed them. Like this guy I saw after school yesterday. I’m a big boy now, see, I don’t need my parents to pick me up, home is just a short walk away. He was standing away from the other parents, didn’t talk to them, just stared at me, that’s how I knew he was one of the ghosts. I went over, told him I knew what he was, and asked how I could help him. I don’t remember much after that, I think because of what happened this morning. Downstairs, my parents were crying. I tried talking to them but they ignored me. They must have died last night somehow, sometimes the new ghosts wouldn’t talk to me. Some police officers and reporters just arrived, they won’t talk to me either, just my parents. It’s weird, I’ve never seen so many ghosts together before. Why won’t anyone talk to me?"
"I can recall what it felt like to lose both of you. To bring both my wife and unborn child to the hospital, praying","I can recall what it felt like to lose both of you. To bring both my wife and unborn child to the hospital, praying for their safety. Despite the shards of glass still lodged in my arms and face, I waited outside the ICU for you. I refused to get treated, which was admittedly stupid. I knew you’d be mad about it once you got out of surgery, but it was worth it to see you the second the doctors were done. You didn’t make it, though. I remember seeing you in the morgue. The lips I’d kissed so many times were gone with the rest of your jaw. The legs you’d wrapped around me were shattered. The arm that bore your wedding band had been torn out of its socket. You and the baby were gone. As bad as this is to say, I wish your eyes were gone too. Your glassy stare felt accusatory. When I finally got home, I fell asleep in an empty bed. An empty house. When I awoke and you were in the baby’s room, rocking him gently (it was a boy? I guess you called it that. I felt at peace. We ate breakfast together. You fed him. I kissed you. I did the dishes. I took the lead on changing his diapers. Our life is going how we expected. It can’t be you, though, right? I saw you dead. I saw him dead. I don’t care to dwell on it, though. My love is still there, and it always will be. I’m really not sure if you’re her or not. If I never ask, I pray you’ll never tell."

She told him to go to bed at eleven but unfortunately, he couldn’t hear her over the sound of his music. Jacob haphazardly waved his mother goodbye as she closed the door. Jacob spent an hour and a half playing with his phone. Games. YouTube videos. Movies. Music. He even texted his best friend for a while until she no longer replied. He didn’t pay any attention to the time. Until his phone battery hit 10%. Jacob realized that his mother never called or texted him in all the time that he had his phone. Jacob sent her a text. “Hey” No reply. He was confused as to why she wouldn’t answer him. She always answered her phone. His confusion chilled intoconcern as night fell and midnight rose. He sent another. “Mom? Where are you?” Again. No answer. “Sweetie?” A familiar voice rang out from behind the couch. It sounded like his mother’s, but it wasn’t. Not entirely. It was warped. Crinkling like folded tin foil. Jacob jumped and spun around. Only for thick black hair to consume his sight. “Why haven’t you gone to bed?”"

He’s in charge of the “new” construction – converting the kitchen into the master bedroom for instance, while I’m on wallpaper removal duty. The previous owner papered EVERY wall and CEILING! Removing it is brutal, but oddly satisfying. The best feeling is getting a long peel, similar to your skin when you’re peeling from a sunburn. I don’t know about you but I kinda make a game of peeling, on the hunt for the longest piece before it rips. Under a corner section of paper in every room is a person’s name and a date. Curiosity got the best of me one night when I Googled one of the names and discovered the person was a missing person, the missing date matching the date under the wallpaper! The next day, I made a list of all the names and dates. Sure enough, each name was for a missing person with dates to match. We notified the police who naturally sent out the crime scene team. I overhead one tech say “Yup, it’s human.” Human? What’s human? “Ma’am, where is the material you removed from the walls already? This isn’t wallpaper you were removing.”"
"Here they come again, the brave ones. Another Halloween night and the kids are back, here to prove","Here they come again, the brave ones. Another Halloween night and the kids are back, here to prove their fearlessness. The old house’s floorboards creak beneath their sneakers. Only half an hour until midnight, so I have to work fast. I start with their flashlight, blowing lightly against it, so that it flickers, but this inspires little more than a nervous giggle. Fifteen minutes until midnight. Time to take things up a notch. I hover up to the ceiling, and will my body into flesh. My every nerve is on fire, but they’ve given me no choice. I force drops of blood to trickle out my nose, but the boys below don’t notice. I knock against the ceiling, but they won’t even look up.”I thought this place was supposed to be haunted,” says the leader. “What a joke.”Five minutes until midnight. I’m running out of time. With the last of my strength, I scream— so loud that they finally turn to look up at me. I like to think I put on a good show: I sway on an invisible noose, and the blood flows freely from my nostrils now. A couple of drops hit a skinny one with a crew cut. The boys scream and run into the night, just in time. Below me, I hear the Thing turn, its disappointment palpable. For now, it sleeps. But one day, I will fail. The boys will be too brave, and I won’t scare them out in time. One day they will wake it."

I am one of the three demons that were assigned to you at birth. You see, some people in this world are destined for greatness, destined to live happy, fulfilling lives. You, I am afraid, are not one of those people, and it is our job to make sure of that. Who are we? Oh yes, of course, how rude of me. Allow me to introduce us: Shame is my younger brother, the demon on your left shoulder. Shame tells you that you’re a freak; that those thoughts you have are not normal; that you will never fit in. Shame whispered into your ear when your mother found you playing with yourself as a child. Shame is the one who makes you hate yourself. Fear sits on your right shoulder. He is my older brother, as old as life itself. Fear fills every dark corner with monsters, and turns every stranger on a dark street into a murderer. Fear stops you from telling your crush how you feel. He tells you it is better not to try than to let people see you fail. Fear makes you build your prison. Who am I, then? I am the worst of your demons, but you see me as a friend. You turn to me when you have nothing else because I live in your heart. I am the one who forces you to endure. The one who prolongs your torment.Sincerely, Hope."
"When I was a child, my family moved to a big old two-story house with big empty rooms and","When I was a child, my family moved to a big old two-story house with big empty rooms and creaking floorboards. Both my parents worked, so I was often alone when I came home from school. One early evening, when I came home, the house was still dark. I called out, “Mum?” and heard her singing voice say, “Yeeeeees?” from upstairs. I called her again as I climbed the stairs to see which room she was in and again got the same “Yeeeeees?” reply. We were decorating at the time, and I didn’t know my way around the maze of rooms, but she was in one of the far ones, right down the hall. I felt uneasy, but I figured that was only natural, so I rushed forward to see my mom, knowing that her presence would calm my fears, as a mother’s presence always does. Just as I reached for the handle of the door to let myself into the room, I heard the front door downstairs open, and my mother called, “Sweetie, are you home?” in a cheery voice. I jumped back, startled, and ran down the stairs to her, but as I glanced back from the top of the stairs, the door to the room slowly opened a crack. For a brief moment, I saw something strange in there, and I don’t know what it was, but it was staring at me."

At this point, I was on a call with my friend for ~20 minutes, and randomly, my bathroom light turned off. I was on the porch with the view on the inside, and the bathroom light turned off, then the bedroom light, then the living room. I moved out three months ago, and I’m home alone. After ~5 minutes, the porch light turned off and the TV followed. ~20 seconds after that, the whole street went dark. It was 12 at that point, and all streetlights and lights were off. I tried turning my TV back on, but nothing happened. My phone suddenly just started playing random music, as if someone had been playing the piano on my phone. ~1 hour later, I tried going to sleep in the pitch black and left my phone in the living room, still playing music. I woke up that morning from a nightmare, and everything was on, as if nothing had happened; nothing was touched, and the TV outside was still on pause from my call and on my phone on the couch. It was off and said I had been on call for 2 hours and 47 minutes. I called my friend, and he just said, “You were talking, then you stopped talking. I waited and nothing. I thought I heard you drop your phone and mumble a few times after just hanging up after awhile.” I still have nightmares and questions from that “day”."

It was getting dark, and having lost his bearings, he decided to head in one direction until he was clear of the increasingly oppressive foliage. After what seemed like hours, he came across a cabin in a small clearing. Realizing how dark it had grown, he decided to see if he could stay there for the night. He approached and found the door ajar. Nobody was inside. The hunter flopped down on the single bed, deciding to explain himself to the owner in the morning. As he looked around, he was surprised to see the walls adorned by many portraits, all painted in incredible detail. Without exception, they appeared to be staring down at him, their features twisted into looks of hatred. Staring back, he grew increasingly uncomfortable. Making a concerted effort to ignore the many hateful faces, he turned to face the wall, and exhausted, he fell into a restless sleep. Face down in an unfamiliar bed, he turned, blinking in unexpected sunlight. Looking up, he discovered that the cabin had no portraits, only windows."

On Thursday, while the entire school was in the gym, we waited just outside the doors. I was to use the gun on whoever walked out first. Then he would take the gun and go into the gym blasting. I walked up to Mr. Quinn the guidance counselor and shot him in the face three times. He fell back into the gym, dead. The shots were deafening. We heard screams in the auditorium one could not see us yet. I handed him the gun and whispered, “Your turn.” He ran into the gym and started firing. I followed a moment after. He hadn’t hit anyone yet. Kids were scrambling and hiding. It was mayhem. I ran up behind him and tackled him. We struggled. I wrenched the gun out of his hands, turned it on him, and killed him. I closed his mouth forever. On Friday, I was anointed a hero. It was indeed the perfect plan."

Jake wakes up asking for his grandpa, and he only sleeps if Grandpa is sitting by his bedside. It is a common sound in our house to hear this wee three-year-old laugh with glee at the stories Grand Papa regales him with. While other kids cling to their parents, I could be gone for hours, and Jake wouldn’t notice because he was with his grandpa. Jake can also be quite the clown. If he finds a stick, he picks it up, holds on to it, bends his little back, and takes even more baby steps to imitate how Grandpa walks. He also crinkles up his face in an adorable frown to imitate Grandpa’s face. “Look, look, Mum, I’m Grand Papa,” he likes to yell out each time he pulls that face. Except, there is no grandpa. Jake’s grandfather, my father, lives 3000 miles away from us. We get to see him maybe once a year, if we are lucky. The house we moved into belonged to an old couple. After her husband died, his wife, the 85-year-old widow, sold the house to us and moved to France to be with her daughter. So yeah, every time Jake calls for his grandpa, a shiver runs down my spine."
A wealthy man wanted to go hunting in a part of northern Canada where few people,"A wealthy man wanted to go hunting in a part of northern Canada where few people had ever hunted. He traveled to a trading post and tried to find a guide to take him. But no one would do it. It was too dangerous, they said. Finally, he found an Indian who needed money badly, and he agreed to take him. The Indian's name was DeFago. They made camp in the snow near a large frozen lake. For three days they hunted, but they had nothing to show for it. The third night a windstorm came up. They lay in their tent listening to the wind howling and the trees whipping back and forth. To see the storm better, the hunter opened the tent flap. What he saw startled him. There wasn't a breath of air, stirring, and the trees were standing perfectly still. Yet he could hear the wind howling. And the more he listened, the more it sounded as if it were calling DeFago's name. ""Da-faaaaaaaaay-go!"" it called. ''Da-faaaaaaaaay-go!'' ""I must be losing my mind,"" the hunter thought. But DeFago had gotten out of his sleeping bag. He was huddled in a corner of the tent, his head buried in his arms. ""What's this all about?"" the hunter asked. ""It's nothing,"" DeFago said. But the wind continued to call to him. And DeFago became more tense and more restless. ""Da-Faaaaaaaaay-go!"" it called. ""Da-faaaaaaaaay-go!"" Suddenly, he jumped to his feet, and he began to run from the tent. But the hunter grabbed him and wrestled him to the ground. ""You can't leave me out here,"" the hunter shouted. Then the wind called again, and DeFago broke loose and ran into the darkness. The hunter could hear him screaming as he went. Again and again he cried, ""Oh, my fiery feet, my burning feet of fire . . ."" Then his voice faded away, and the wind died down. At daybreak, the hunter followed DeFago's tracks in the snow. They went through the woods, down toward the lake, then out onto the ice. But soon he noticed something strange. The steps DeFago had taken got longer and longer. They were so long no human being could have taken them. It was as if something had helped him to hurry away. The hunter followed the tracks out to the middle of the lake, but there they disappeared. At first, he thought that DeFago had fallen through the ice, but there wasn't any hole. Then he thought that something had pulled him off the ice into the sky. But that made no sense. As he stood wondering what had happened, the wind I picked up again. Soon it was howling as it had the night before. Then he heard DeFago's voice. It was coming from up above, and again he heard DeFago screaming, • . My fiery feet, my burning feet . . ."" But there was nothing to be seen. Now the hunter wanted to leave that place as fast as he could. He went back to camp and packed. Then he left some food for DeFago, and he started out. Weeks later he reached civilization. The following year he went back to hunt in that area again. He went to the same trading post to look for a guide. The people there could not explain what had happened to DeFago that night. But they had not seen him since then. “Maybe it was the Wendigo,"" one of them said, and he laughed. “It's supposed to come with the wind. It drags you along at great speed until your feet are burned away, and more of you than that. Then it carries you into the sky, and it drops you. It's just a crazy story, but that's what some of the Indians say.'' A few days later the hunter was at the trading post again. An Indian came in and sat by the fire. He had a blanket wrapped around him, and he wore his hat so that you couldn't see his face. The hunter thought there was something familiar about him. He walked over and he asked, “Are you DeFago?"" The Indian didn't answer. “Do you know anything about him?"" No answer. He began to wonder if something was wrong, if the man needed help. But he couldn't see his face. ""Are you all right?"" he asked. No answer. To get a look at him, he lifted the Indian's hat. Then he screamed. There was nothing under the hat but a pile of ashes."

But it can be played whenever the spirit moves you. The players sit in a circle in a darkened room and listen to a storyteller describe the rotting remains of a corpse. Each part is passed around for them to feel. In one version, a player is out if he or she screams or gasps with fright. In another version, everybody stays to the end, no matter how scared they get. Here is the story: Once in this town there lived a man named Brown. It was years ago, on this night, that he was murdered out of spite. We have here his remains. First, let's feel his brains. (A wet, squishy tomato) Now here are his eyes, still frozen with surprise. (Two peeled grapes) This is his nose. (A chicken bone) Here is his ear. (A dried apricot) And here is his hand, rotting flesh and bone. (A cloth or rubber glove filled with mud or ice) But his hair still grows. (A handful of corn silk or wet fur or yarn) And his heart still beats, now and then. (A piece of raw liver) And his blood still flows. Dip your fingers in it. It's nice and warm. (A bowl of catsup thinned with warm water) That's all there is, except for these worms. They are the ones that ate the rest of him. (A handful of wet, cooked spaghetti noodles) "

It was about midnight when they finished their game, and he started home. Outside it was icy cold and as quiet as the grave. As he came around a turn in the road, he was surprised to see a woman walking ahead of him. She was carrying a basket covered with a white cloth. When he caught up to her, he looked to see who it was. But she was so bundled up against the cold, it was hard to see her face. ""Good evening,"" Sam said. ""What brings you out so late?"" But she didn't answer. Then he said, ""May I carry your basket?"" She handed it to him. From under the cloth, a small voice said, ""That's very nice of you,"" and that was followed by wild laughter. Sam was so startled that he dropped the basket — and out rolled a woman's head. He looked at the head, and he stared at the woman. ""It's her head!"" he cried. And he started to run, and the woman and her head began to chase him. Soon the head caught up to him. It bounded into the air and sunk its teeth into his left leg. Sam screamed with pain and ran faster. But the woman and her head stayed right behind. Soon the head leaped into the air again and bit into his other leg. Then they were gone. Donald and Sarah went to the movies. Then they went for a ride in Donald's car. They parked up on a hill at the edge of town. From there they could see the lights up and down the valley.

His left hand was missing. In its place, he wore a hook. “Let's roll up the windows and lock the doors/' said Sarah. “That's a good idea/' said Donald. “That prison isn't too far away,"" said Sarah. “Maybe we really should go home. 7 ' “But it's only ten o'clock/' said Donald. “I don't care what time it is,"" she said. “I want to go home."" “Look, Sarah,"" said Donald, “he's not going to climb all the way up here. Why would he do that? Even if he did, all the doors are locked. How could he get in?""  “Donald, he could take that hook and break through a window and open a door,"" she said. “I'm scared. I want to go home."" Donald was annoyed. “Girls always are afraid of some- thing,"" he said. As he started the car, Sarah thought she heard some- one, or something, scratching at her door. “Did you hear that?"" she asked as they roared away. “It sounded like somebody was trying to get in."" ""Oh, sure,"" said Donald. Soon they got to her house. ""Would you like to come in and have some cocoa?"" she asked. ""No,"" he said, ""I've got to go home."" He went around to the other side of the car to let her out. Hanging on the door handle was a hook."
A young man invited a young woman to a formal dance. But she was very poor,"A young man invited a young woman to a formal dance. But she was very poor, and she could not afford to buy the evening gown she needed for such an occasion. ""Maybe you can rent a dress,"" her mother said. So she went to a pawnshop not far from where she lived. There she found a white satin evening gown in her size. She looked lovely in it, and she was able to rent it for very little. When she arrived at the dance with her friend, she was so attractive, everyone wanted to meet her. She danced again and again and was having a wonderful time. But then she began to feel dizzy and faint, and she asked her friend to take her home. ""I think I have danced too much,"" she told him. When she got home, she lay down on her bed. The next morning her mother found that her daughter had died. The doctor did not understand what had caused her death. So he had the coroner perform an autopsy. The coroner found that she had been poisoned by em- balming fluid. It had stopped her blood from flowing. There were traces of the fluid on her dress. He decided it had entered her skin when she perspired while she was dancing. The pawnbroker said he bought the dress from an un- dertaker's helper. It had been used in a funeral for another young woman, and the helper had stolen it just before she was buried. The girl driving the old blue sedan was a senior at the high school. She lived on a farm about eight miles away and used the car to drive back and forth. She had driven into town that night to see a basketball game. Now she was on her way home. As she pulled \away from the school, she noticed a red pick-up truck follow her out of the parking lot. A few minutes later the truck was still behind her. ""I guess we're going in the same direction,” she thought. She began to watch the truck in her mirror. When she changed her speed, the driver of the truck changed his speed. When she passed a car, so did he."
"Then he turned on his high beams, flooding her car with light. He left them","Then he turned on his high beams, flooding her car with light. He left them on for almost a minute. ""He probably wants to pass me,"" she thought. But she was becoming uneasy. Usually she drove home over a back road. Not too many people went that way. But when she turned onto that road, so did the truck. ""I've got to get away from him,"" she thought, and she began to drive faster. Then he turned his high beams on again. After a minute, he turned them off. Then he turned them on again and off again. She drove even faster, but the truck driver stayed right behind her. Then he turned his high beams on again. Once more her car was ablaze with light. ""What is he doing?"" she wondered. ""What does he want?"" Then he turned them off again. But a minute later he had them on again, and he left them on. At last she pulled into her driveway, and the truck pulled in right behind her. She jumped from the car and ran to the house. ""Call the police!"" she screamed at her father. Out in the driveway she could see the driver of the truck. He had a gun in his hand. When the police arrived, they started to arrest him, but he pointed to the girl's car. ""You don't want me,"" he said. ""You want him."" Crouched behind the driver's seat, there was a man with a knife. As the driver of the truck explained it, the man slipped into the girl's car just before she left the school. He saw it happen, but there was no way he could stop it. He thought about getting the police, but he was afraid to leave her. So he followed her car. Each time the man in the back seat reached up to over- power her, the driver of the truck turned on his high beams. Then the man dropped down, afraid that someone might see him. It was nine o'clock in the evening. Everybody was sitting on the couch in front of the TV. There were Richard, Brian, Jenny, and Doreen, the babysitter. The telephone rang."
"Maybe it's your mother,"" said Doreen. She picked up the phone. Before she could say a word","“Maybe it's your mother,"" said Doreen. She picked up the phone. Before she could say a word, a man laughed hysterically and hung up. “Who was it?"" asked Richard. “Some nut,"" said Doreen. “What did I miss?"" At nine-thirty the telephone rang again. Doreen answered it. It was the man who had called before. “I'll be there soon,"" he said, and he laughed and hung up. “Who was it?"" the children asked. “Some crazy person,"" she said. About ten o'clock the telephone rang again. Jenny got to it first. “Hello,"" she said. It was the same man. “One more hour,"" he said, and he laughed and hung up. “He said, 'One more hour.' What did he mean?"" asked Jenny. “Don't worry,"" said Doreen. “It's somebody fooling around."" “I'm scared,"" said Jenny. About ten-thirty the telephone rang once more. When Doreen picked it up, the man said, “Pretty soon now,"" and he laughed. "" Why are you doing this?"" Doreen screamed, and he hung up. “Was it that guy again?"" asked Brian. “Yes,"" said Doreen. ""I'm going to call the operator and complain."" The operator told her to call back if it happened again. and she would try to trace the call. At eleven o'clock the telephone rang again. Doreen answered it. ""Very soon now/' the man said, and he laughed and hung up. Doreen called the operator. Almost at once she called back. ""That person is calling from a telephone upstairs,"" she said. ""You'd better leave. I'll get the police."" Just then a door upstairs opened. A man they had never seen before started down the stairs toward them. As they ran from the house, he was smiling in a very strange way. A few minutes later, the police found him there and arrested him.A widow lived alone on the top floor of an apartment house. One morning her telephone rang. “Hello/' she said. “This is the viper,"" a man said. “I'm coming up."" “Somebody is fooling around,"" she thought, and hung up. A half-hour later the telephone rang again. It was the same man. “It's the viper,"" he said. ""I'll be up soon."" The widow didn't know what to think, but she was getting frightened. Once more the telephone rang. Again it was the viper. ""I'm coming up now,"" he said. She quickly called the police. They said they would be right over. When the doorbell rang, she sighed with relief. ""They are here!"" she thought. But when she opened the door, there stood a little old man with a bucket and a cloth. ""I am the viper,"" he said. ""I vish to vash and vipe the vindows."" "
A man named Rupert lived with his dog in a house deep in the woods. Rupert was a hunter,"A man named Rupert lived with his dog in a house deep in the woods. Rupert was a hunter and a trapper. The dog was a big German shepherd named Sam. Rupert had raised Sam from a pup. Almost every morning Rupert went hunting, and Sam stayed behind and guarded the house. One morning, as Rupert was checking his traps, he got the feeling that something was wrong at home. He hurried back as fast as he could, but when he got there he found that Sam was missing. He searched the house and the woods nearby, but Sam was nowhere to be seen. He called and he called, but the dog did not answer. For days Rupert looked for Sam, but he could find no trace of him. Finally he gave up and went back to his work. But one morning he heard something moving in the attic. He picked up his gun. Then he thought, ""I'd better be quiet about this."" So he took off his boots. And in his bare feet he began to climb the attic stairs. He slowly took one step — then another — then another, until at last he reached the attic door. He stood outside listening, but he didn't hear a thing. Then he opened the door, and — ""AAAAAAAAAAAH!"" (At this point, the storyteller stops, as if he has finished. Then usually somebody will ask, ""Why did Rupert scream?"" The storyteller replies, ""You'd scream too if you stepped on a nail in your bare feet."")"
Aaron Kelly was dead. They bought him a coffin and had a funeral and buried him. But that night ,"Aaron Kelly was dead. They bought him a coffin and had a funeral and buried him. But that night he got out of his coffin, and he came home. His family was sitting around the fire when he walked in. He sat down next to his widow, and he said, ""What's going on? You all act like somebody died. Who's dead?"" His widow said, ""You are.""  ""I don't feel dead,"" he said. ""I feel fine."" ""You don't look fine,"" his widow said. ""You look dead. You'd better get back to the grave where you belong.""  ""I'm not going back to the grave until I feel dead,"" he said. Since Aaron wouldn't go back, his widow couldn't collect his life insurance. Without that, she couldn't pay for the coffin. And the undertaker said he would take it back. Aaron didn't care. He just sat by the fire rocking in a chair and warming his hands and feet. But his joints were dry and his back was stiff, and every time he moved, he creaked and cracked. One night the best fiddler in town came to court the widow. Since Aaron was dead, the fiddler wanted to marry her. The two of them sat on one side of the fire, and Aaron sat on the other side, creaking and cracking. ""How long do we have to put up with this dead corpse?"" the widow asked. ""Something must be done,"" the fiddler said. ""This isn't very jolly,"" Aaron said. ""Let's dance!"" The fiddler got out his fiddle and began to play. Aaron stretched himself, shook himself, got up, took a step or two, and began to dance. With his old bones rattling, and his yellow teeth snap- ping, and his bald head wagging, and his arms flip-flopping — around and around he went. With his long legs clicking, and his kneebones knocking, he skipped and pranced around the room. How that dead man danced! But pretty soon a bone worked loose and fell to the floor. ""Look at that!"" said the fiddler. ""Play faster!"" said the widow. The fiddler played faster. Crickety-crack, down and back, the dead man went hopping, and his dry bones kept dropping — this way, that way, the pieces just kept popping. ""Play, man! Play!"" cried the widow. The fiddler fiddled, and dead Aaron danced. Then Aaron fell apart, collapsed into a pile of bones — all except his bald headbone that grinned at the fiddler, cracked its teeth — and kept dancing. ""Look at that!"" groaned the fiddler. ""Play louder!"" cried the widow. ""Ho, ho!"" said the headbone. ""Ain't we having fun!"" The fiddler couldn't stand it. ""Widow,"" he said. ""I'm going home,"" and he never came back. The family gathered up Aaron's bones and put them back in the coffin. They mixed them up so he couldn't fit them together. After that, Aaron stayed in his grave. But his widow never did get married again. Aaron had seen to that."
"An old man was out for a walk. When a storm came up, he looked for a place to take","An old man was out for a walk. When a storm came up, he looked for a place to take shelter. Soon he came to an old house. He ran up on the porch and knocked on the door, but nobody answered. By now rain was pouring down, thunder was booming, and lightning was flashing. So he tried the door. When he found it was unlocked, he went inside. Except for a pile of wooden boxes, the house was empty. He broke up some of the boxes and made a fire with them. Then he sat down in front of the fire and dried himself. It was so warm and cozy that he fell asleep. When he woke up a black cat was sitting near the fire. It stared at him for a while. Then it purred. ""That's a nice cat,"" he thought, and he dozed off again. When he opened his eyes, there was a second cat in the room. But this one was as big as a wolf. It looked at him very closely, and it asked, ""Shall we do it now?"" ""No,"" said the other cat. ""Let's wait till Martin comes."" ""I must be dreaming,"" thought the old man. He closed his eyes again. Then he took another look. But now there was a third cat in the room, and this one was as big as a tiger. It looked the old man over, and it asked, ""Shall we do it now?"" ""No,"" said the others. ""Let's wait till Martin comes."" The old man jumped up, jumped out the window and started running. ""When Martin comes, you tell him I couldn't wait,"" he called. A businessman arrived at a hotel late one night and asked for a room. The room clerk told him the hotel was all filled up. ""There is only one empty room,"" he said. ""But we don't rent that one because it is haunted."" ""I'll take it,"" said the businessman. ""I don't believe in ghosts."" The man went up to the room. He unpacked his things, and he went to bed. As soon as he did, a ghost came out of the closet. Its fingers were bleeding, and it was"
"moaning, “Bloody fingers! Bloody fingers!"" When the man saw the ghost, he grabbed his things","moaning, “Bloody fingers! Bloody fingers!"" When the man saw the ghost, he grabbed his things and ran. The next night a woman arrived very late. Again, all the rooms were taken except the haunted room. ""I'll sleep there,"" she said. ""I'm not afraid of ghosts."" As soon as she got into bed, the ghost came out of the closet. Its fingers still were bleeding. It still was moaning, ""Bloody fingers! Bloody fingers!"" And the woman took one look and ran. A week later another guest arrived very late. He also took the haunted room. After he unpacked, he got out his guitar and he began to play. Soon the ghost appeared. As before, its fingers were bleeding, and it was moaning, ""Bloody fingers! Bloody fingers!"" The man paid no attention. He just kept strumming his guitar. But the ghost kept moaning, and its fingers kept bleeding. Finally, the guitar player looked up. ""Cool it, man!"" he said. ""Get yourself a Band-Aid."" “If you got your pause right, she'll fetch a dear little yelp and spring right out of her shoes. . . There are three approaches to telling these jump stories. Two are found in Chapter 1. In the third approach, the ghost returns to search for what has been stolen. Feigning innocence, the grave robber asks what has become of various parts of the ghost's body. To each question, the ghost replies, “All withered and wasted away."" When the robber mentions the part of the body that was stolen, the ghost shrieks, "" You 've got it!"" See Botkin, American, pp. 502-503; Burrison; Roberts, Old Greasybeard, pp. 33-36; Stimson, JAF 58:126. Ghosts (pp. 21-34): In almost every civilization, there has been a belief that the dead return. They are said to come back for various reasons. Their lives were ended before their allotted time."" They did not receive a proper burial. They had important business to finish or a responsibility to meet. They wished to punish somebody or to take revenge. Or they wanted to comfort or advise someone or obtain forgiveness. It is said that some return as human beings. In fact, they may look just as they did when they were alive, and people they meet may not realize they are ghosts. One of the best known of these “living ghosts"" is the ghostly or vanishing hitchhiker. It usually is late at night that a motorist encounters her. She is standing on a street corner or at the side of a road, and she asks to be taken home. She sits in the back seat of the car. But when the driver finds the address he has been given, he discovers that she has vanished. When he informs her family of this, he learns that she died on that night several years before at the spot where he picked her up.There are two stories about living ghosts in Chapter 2: “The Guests"" and ""Cold as Clay."" Some persons who die are said to return as animals, particularly as dogs. Other ghosts may have a spectral quality. Or they may appear as a ball of fire or as a moving light. Or they may make their presence known through sounds they make or actions they take, such as slamming a door, rattling a key in a lock, or moving furniture. The ghosts of animals also have been reported, as have the ghosts of objects such as guns, boots, and rifles, and trains and cars associated with death. Ghosts of human beings do many things a human does. They eat, drink, ride on trains and buses, play the piano, and go fishing. They also laugh, cry, shout, whisper, and make all sorts of noises. When it has completed what it set out to do, a ghost is likely to return to its grave. But at times this may require the help of a person, such as a minister, who may be experienced in “laying” ghosts, or putting them to rest. If you wish to see or hear a ghost, these are some recommended approaches: Look back over your left shoulder. Look through either one of a mule's ears. Look in a mirror with another person. Arrange six pure white dinner plates around a table, then go to a cemetery at noon and call the name of someone you once knew who is buried there. If you encounter a ghost, it is advised that you speak to it. If you do so, you may be able to help it finish whatever it is doing and return to its grave. Some say it is most effective if you address a ghost this way: “In the name of God [or in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost], what do you want?"" They also say that holding a Bible will protect you against a revengeful ghost and demonstrate your sincerity. However, most ghosts are not regarded as dangerous. As the folklorist Maria Leach pointed out, “Usually a ghost is some poor harmless soul . . . looking for someone with enough understanding and kindness to speak to it and do it  some little favor.” See Beardsley and Hankie, CFQ 1:303-36; CFQ 2:3-25; Creighton, pp. i-xi; Hole, pp. 1-12; Gardner, p. 85; Leach, Dictionary, ""Revenant,” pp. 933-34; Leach Thins pp. 9-11. *' "" The ?"" (PP- 23-24): This tale describes a forerunner, or a forewarning of death. The warning is a skeletonlike figure that appears, then chases the principal characters. The skeleton actually is a ""wraith,” an apparition that depicts a living person as he or she will look at death. But the most commonly re- ported forerunners are heard, not seen. They are sounds like a knock on the door or the striking of a clock. See Creighton pp. 1-7, 69-70. The Haunted Ho ™"" (PP- 29-32): The tale of a person who is brave enough to spend a night in a haunted house, and who often is rewarded for his bravery, is told again and again around the world. There are many versions of this story, but the theme never changes. In this book there are four disparate variants of this tale: ""Me Tie Dough-ty Walker!"" ""The Haunted House,” ""Wait till Martin Comes,” and ""The Ghost with the Bloody Fingers."" The tale is classified as Type 326 (the youth who wanted to know what fear was). SeeIves, A/ff 4:61-67; Roberts, Old Greasybeard, pp. 72-74, 187; Roberts, South, pp. 35-38, 217-18. ""The Hearse Song"" (p. 39): Although many adults are familiarwith this song, it is best known in the elementary schools But during World War I, it was a war song that was sung by servicemen from America and England. One version went this way: ""Did you ever think as the hearse rolls by That some of these days you must surely die? They'll take you away in a big black hack; They'll take you away but they won't bring you back. . . And your eyes drop out and your teeth fall in And the worms crawl over your mouth and chin; And the worms crawl out and the worms crawl in And your limbs drop off limb by limb."" The words have changed quite a bit since then. Worms now play pinochle on your snout. There is jelly between your toes. And pus, like whipping cream, pours out of your stomach. With children as the audience, it is a more gruesome song, but it is not as grim. One scholar associates the change of words with a change of function. During World War I, the song helped servicemen deal with the fear they felt. These days it helps children confirm the reality of death, yet through satire and humor deny its reality for them. The song is part of an old poetic tradition. During the Middle Ages many of the poems written in European countries dealt with death and decay. Here is a verse of this type from a twelfth-century poem, which has been translated from the Middle English: ""A vicious worm lives in my backbone; My eyes are dazed and very dim; My guts rot, my hair is green. My teeth grin very grimly."""

Her beautiful, sparkling eyes drew me in; they were a reflection of heaven, and her voice, a chorus of angels. I proposed after we graduated from college and we planned our future together. But things have changed since then; she’s been acting strange lately. In bed she’d toss and turn all night, muttering under her breath. Some nights I’d hear other strange noises, like faint screams. I still loved her, though. We decided to get married at our local church. Before I knew it, I was waiting at the altar for her to walk down the aisle. I nodded to the priest and signaled to the men sitting in the front row. We pinned her on top of the altar as the priest wrapped her arms and legs in chains. She hissed and howled, her body writhing in agony. The priest grasped the crucifix in front of her face and began the recitation. I wasn’t going to let her go. I wanted my wife back."

He hears footsteps outside his door and peeks out of his eyes to see what is happening. His door swings open quietly to reveal a murderer carrying the corpses of his parents. After silently propping them up on a chair, he writes something on the wall in the blood of the dead bodies. He then hides under the child’s bed. The child is scared beyond belief. He can’t read the writing on the wall, and he knows the man is under his bed. Like any child, he pretends that he slept through the whole thing and hasn’t awoken yet. He lays still as the bodies, quietly hearing the breaths from under his bed. An hour passes, and his eyes are adjusting more and more to the darkness. He tries to make out the words, but it’s a struggle. He gasps when he finally makes out the sentence. “I know you’re awake.” He feels something shift underneath his bed."

If I tried to move I’d get a really loud ringing noise in both my ears it would get louder each time I moved. I was terrified. I was too scared to open my eyes but I felt a presence of someone in the room with me (my room isn’t completely dark because I have a small blue night light). I open my eyes and see a very tall and dark figure with two horns on each side of his head just standing there in the corner of my room facing me. I panic and try to move my body the ringing gets louder and louder and louder and I can feel myself crying. I close my eyes and in my head start saying “ God will protect me, God will protect me.” Then, I hear a low evil voice say “ God can’t help you anymore..”"

There was no doubt as to her authenticity. She appeared to all nations at once. All believed. All worshipped her. Sometime later, after this period of our history known as the Age of Peace, She dropped a bombshell on us. She warned us that Heaven was almost full. Nobody had gone to Hell during this Age. There were a fixed amount of spots left. Paradise would be closed to all who died after the Gates closed. That is when the Mass Suicides began. Taking your own life, She had told us, was not a sin if you died a pious man. The race was on! She looked on and was pleased. She returned to her home, to her throne of fire and flames, and greeted all with a nod of her wicked horns."

So very long. My siblings beside me yearned for freedom just as I did. When the ice gave way, we would burst forth and see what the world offered us. I hoped it was thriving out there. Drip, drip, drip. We needed it to be thriving. Whatever was out there wasn’t ready for us, I was sure. Our hosts, whatever form they took, were unsuspecting.
