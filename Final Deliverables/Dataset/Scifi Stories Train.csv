The paint glows and has all the colors of a rainbow. He soon notices that the paint is spreading, and when he removes his shirt it jumps onto his skin. When he attempts to rub it off, it flows back on. He then attempts to use various chemicals to remove it, using every solvent he can find and even some of his precious rocket fuel.

After filling part of a bucket, he notices that there is no less paint on him than before – it appears to be self-repairing.

Unfortunately that insulation quality will kill him due to overheating, long before the equally worrying possibility of it covering his body completely. Thinking about the problem, he realizes that such a perfect paint had to be manufactured by an advanced technology. He turns on his radio and is quickly contacted by the Venusians. They explain that their bodies are so hideous that they are afraid the sight of them will drive humans mad. They have developed the can of paint with human telepathy at great expense as a sort of IQ test, and that if he lives through the test and is also able to look at them, any following visitor with his IQ or better will be allowed in. After apologizing for all the bother, they disconnect. Careful not to lift the cube again, he places his hand on the handle and it begins ""I contain 2/3rds paint... "" and then goes on to read out a complete list of ingredients and application instructions. The primary ingredient is liquid light, and the instructions say it can be easily removed by applying darkness paste. Initially finding this amusing because he does not know where the hardware store is, he suddenly realizes he has a solution. The action continues with him on his way back to Earth, talking on the radio to another ship making the journey. He explains that he lined his fuel tank with solar cells, capturing the light given off from the paint while blocking any light from outside falling on it. It eventually ran out of energy and fell off as a powder. He mentions that he is returning with his ship completely filled with cans of this indestructible, self-applying, insulating perfect paint, from which he hopes to make his fortune."
"The main viewpoint character, Roger Jourgensen, is a CIA analyst who writes up a report on the state of both the U.S.","The main viewpoint character, Roger Jourgensen, is a CIA analyst who writes up a report on the state of both the U.S. and Soviet governments' occult research for incoming President Ronald Reagan. This report attracts the attention of ""the Colonel"" (later named as ""Colonel North""; implied to be Oliver North), who arranges for Jourgensen's transfer and for him to work on a variant of the Iran–Contra affair: secret dealings between the U.S. and Iran to counter Saddam Hussein's Iraq, frustrate the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, as well as arrange the freeing of hostages in Lebanon. In this Cold War the U.S. and NATO lag behind the Soviets in mastery of the dark arts, and rely on nuclear weapons as their main countermeasure. The Soviets gained their knowledge from Nazi Germany, which had moved a sleeping entity from an underwater city in the Baltic Sea; the entity is now contained at Chernobyl. They have also deployed ""servitors"", unstoppable robot-like beings found in the original Pabodie expedition. Satellite reconnaissance by the U.S. shows that the servitors may have been deployed in Afghanistan, which would violate a secret multinational treaty prohibiting the use of these alien entities in war to which even Adolf Hitler adhered. U.S. countermeasures include 300 megatons of nuclear weapons and a continuity of government base hundreds of light years from Earth, connected via a gate in Washington. The CIA also uses these gates to other planets as roundabout ways to transport drugs and arms to and from the Afghan mujahideen as part of Operation Cyclone. Stephen Jay Gould briefs the CIA on the evolutionary implications of the alien lifeforms, confirming they come from no Earthly source. Other nations emulate the superpowers; Iran and Israel covertly plan a joint nuclear defence against Iraq's attempts to open a gate to the stars. Eventually, the Colonel's dealings are leaked, and Jourgensen has to testify before a congressional committee. One congressman, horrified by the accounts of the Colonel's dabbling, inquires about the Great Filter: why no aliens have openly stopped by to visit humanity, and only relics and servants remain. He points out that meddling with relics of the Elder Ones would be a good explanation for why other intelligent life has been exterminated before it could visit.While the committee is in session, Saddam manages to stabilise the gate of Yog-Sothoth, destroying opposing tribes in Iraq and causing Iran to retaliate with a nuclear attack. The timing unfortunately lines up with a joke by President Reagan; the Soviets and their leader Yegor Ligachev retaliate, with a nuclear war destroying the Middle East and much of the U.S. and Soviet Union. More worryingly, the entity behind the Soviet program, Cthulhu, has somehow been loosed; the U.S. nuclear strike does not appear to slow it down as it heads west across the Atlantic Ocean. Jourgensen and other U.S. personnel retreat to a hidden constructed colony on a distant dying planet, codenamed XK-Masada. There, riven by phantom voices, Jourgensen contemplates suicide. He decides against it, as death would be no escape if – as he suspects – he has been devoured by Yog-Sothoth already."

The white-faced man says that he has little time for dream analysis because, he says, his dreams are killing him. He goes on to tell how he has been experiencing consecutive dreams of an unspecified future time in which he is a major political figure who has given up his position to live with a younger woman on the island of Capri. The dreamer describes the island in detail, despite never having visited it, which impresses the narrator, who has actually been to Capri. The dreamer tells how his dream idyll comes to an end. While dancing, he is approached by an envoy from his own country who implores him to return and resume his old role before his successor brings about a war. However, this would mean leaving the woman he loves, and his dream self chooses love over duty. For three weeks of dreams, the solicitor is present at the collapse of the paradisical island of Capri and the future world, while war draws closer and flights of military aircraft are described flying overhead. Global war finally erupts, and his dream life ends in worldwide catastrophe and personal tragedy: the dreamer sees his love killed and experiences his own death. At the very end of the story the protagonist reveals that despite being killed in his dream, he nevertheless carried on dreaming even as his body was being ravaged by ""great birds that fought and tore."""

It tells the story of Odili, a young teacher in a small African country who becomes involved in politics and is swept into a corrupt world of greed and power. The novel is set in an unnamed fictional African country, and it provides a scathing critique of post-colonial African politics and the challenges faced by newly independent nations. The story is narrated by Odili, who initially supports Chief Nanga, a charismatic politician and former teacher, in his bid for re-election. However, as Odili becomes more involved in politics, he quickly realizes that Chief Nanga and his associates are deeply corrupt, using their positions of power for personal gain at the expense of the people they are supposed to serve. As the story unfolds, Odili becomes disillusioned with Chief Nanga's hypocrisy and the widespread corruption that permeates the political system. He becomes embroiled in a struggle against the corrupt elite, attempting to expose their wrongdoing and stand up for the common people. Along the way, Odili faces various challenges and betrayals, including from people he once considered friends. Through vivid and engaging storytelling, Achebe portrays the complexities and contradictions of African politics, shedding light on the challenges of nation-building, the abuse of power, and the struggle for integrity and social justice. ""A Man of the People"" is a thought-provoking novel that explores the intricacies of African politics and the human condition, and it remains a relevant and powerful critique of political corruption in contemporary societies"

The loss of solar heating has caused the Earth's atmosphere to freeze into thick layers of ""snow"". The boy's father had worked with a group of other scientists to construct a large shelter, but the earthquakes accompanying the disaster had destroyed it and killed the others. He managed to construct a smaller, makeshift shelter called the ""Nest"" for his family, where they maintain a breathable atmosphere by periodically retrieving pails of frozen oxygen to thaw over a fire. They have survived in this way for a number of years. At the end, they are found by a search party from a large group of survivors at Los Alamos, where they are using nuclear power to provide heat and have begun using rockets to search for other survivors (radio being ineffective at long range without an ionosphere). They reveal that other groups of humans have survived at Argonne, Brookhaven, and Harwell nuclear research facilities as well as in Tannu Tuva, and that plans are being made to establish uranium-mining colonies at Great Slave Lake or in the Congo region."

A hunter named Eckels pays $10,000 to join a hunting party that will travel back 65 million years to the Late Cretaceous period, on a guided safari to kill a Tyrannosaurus rex. As the party waits to depart, they discuss the recent presidential elections in which a far-right candidate, Deutscher, has been defeated by his opponent Keith, to the relief of many concerned. When the party arrives in the past, Travis, the hunting guide, and his assistant warn Eckels and the two other hunters about the necessity of minimizing the events they change before they go back, since even the smallest alterations to the distant past could snowball into catastrophic changes in history. Travis explains that the hunters are obliged to stay on a levitating path to avoid disrupting the environment, any deviation will be punished with hefty fines and prosecution, Time Safari scouts had been sent back to select and tag prey whose death will have minimal effect on the future prior to the hunt, and the time machine ""steps aside"" to prevent people from encountering themselves in the past. Although Eckels is initially excited about the hunt, when the monstrous T-Rex approaches, he loses his nerve. Travis tells him to go back to the time machine, but Eckels panics, steps off the path, and stumbles into the forest. The other four shoot and kill the dinosaur and see that Eckels has found his way back to the time machine. Travis threatens to leave him in the past before ordering him to remove the bullets from the dinosaur's body, as they cannot be left behind. Upon returning to 2055, Eckels and the rest of the party notice major changes; English words are now spelled phonetically, and worst of all, Deutscher has won the election to the approval of the pro-fascist populace. Looking at the mud on his boots, Eckels finds a crushed golden butterfly, whose death has apparently changed the nature of the alternative present to which the safari has returned. He frantically pleads to undo the damage, and is presumably shot by a furious Travis."

Human personalities","In the year 2161, a new medical specialty has been developed, known as ""Mind Sculpting."" Human personalities from history are re-created and placed into voluntarily donated physical bodies. Two mind sculptors, Drs. Kris and Seirds, re-create the mind of Richard Strauss and place it in a body. After animation, the ""new"" Dr Strauss is encouraged to re-commence his life as a composer of music, which he does. After some difficulty adjusting to the current techniques and theories of musical composition, which are based largely on random choices on a composition machine, Strauss searches for subjects to inspire him and composes several songs. He then comes across a play by Christopher Fry, Venus Observed, which he realises is an ideal subject for his music. Working to a tight deadline, he completes the opera and conducts its premiere. But during the performance, he begins to suspect that something isn't quite right, and finally realises that he's used all the same musical language many times before and that he has nothing left to say musically. The applause, when it comes, is not for him, but for the mind sculptors, and Strauss realises that it was all an experiment. Before the sculptors pronounce the formulation that will destroy the re-created mind and restore the mind of the donor – a man completely devoid of musical ability – he feels the satisfaction that the sculptors will never know that the music lacked any spark of genius: ""the 'Strauss' [they] had created was as empty of genius as a hollow gourd."" His final regret is that he will not now be able to set to music Personae, a poem by Ezra Pound appropriate to the occasion that he had just discovered."

One of the children, Margot, moved to Venus from Earth five years earlier and is the only one who remembers the sun, since it shines regularly on Earth. She describes the sun to the other children as being like a ""penny"" or ""fire in the stove"". The other children, being too young to have ever seen it themselves, do not believe her. Just before the sun comes out, a boy named William rallies the other children, and they lock Margot in a closet down a tunnel. The teacher arrives to take the class outside to enjoy their hour of sunshine. In their astonishment and joy, they all forget about Margot and gleefully rush to play outside, savoring every second of their newfound freedom. It begins to rain again, and the children start crying once they realize they won't get to see the sun again for another seven years. The children run back inside as the sun disappears and it starts storming. At this point, one of them remembers Margot. They let her out of the closet and stand frozen, ashamed over what they have done now that they finally understand what she had been missing."

Alarmed, captain McNaught devises a plan to pass the inspection anyway: on the assumption that ""offog"" must be the nickname of some obscure and unnecessary technological device, he orders communications officer Burman to simply fabricate a small box with blinkenlights and feed the inspecting officer some technobabble about what it does. The ruse seems to work, and the Bustler passes inspection. Shortly afterward, the ship is unexpectedly ordered to return to Earth for a complete overhaul; Burman warns McNaught that the engineers of the shipyard will immediately see through their ruse. The captain solves the new problem by having Burman discreetly dispose of the ""offog,"" blandly messaging headquarters that the item had ""came apart under gravitational stress"" while the ship passed close to a star. Two days later, an almost-unprecedented emergency transmission recalls Earth's entire space fleet to the nearest port; an equally urgent query addressed to the Bustler makes the horrified McNaught and Burman belatedly realize that ""offog"" had been a typo for ""off.dog,"" or ""official dog."""
In the far future humanity has begun to interact with aliens from all over the galaxy. A journalist has arrived,"In the far future humanity has begun to interact with aliens from all over the galaxy. A journalist has arrived on a space station in hopes of photographing an alien ship. He encounters a station engineer who tells him about his past and issues him a warning. When the engineer was a young pre-med student he became obsessed with aliens despite watching similar obsessions result in death or permanent physical and mental harm. The engineer sacrificed a promising medical career in order to obtain an unfulfilling one that would allow him to go into space. He has also spent more money than he should wooing generally uninterested aliens. He warns the journalist that aliens do not interact with other alien species and do not seek out humans either. The humans instead come to them, driven by their obsession and willing to act as menial servants for even aliens deemed failures by their own species. The aliens rarely take humans as sexual partners and never as romantic ones. The engineer theorizes that this obsession, which he views as uncontrollable due to humanity's sex drive, has dramatically reduced the birth rate. He also implies that aliens hold humanity in low regard due to their continued destruction of Earth. The engineer's wife arrives, heavily scarred and fatigued from interactions with the aliens. He reveals that theirs is a loveless marriage of convenience, as the station exclusively hires married couples. The agreement allows them to pursue aliens, even as both seem aware of the negative repercussions. The engineer begs the journalist to return to Earth and warn others to stay away from aliens. The story ends with the infatuated journalist choosing instead to pursue his first interaction with aliens."

Bob Carson, the pilot of a small one-man scout ship, blacks out while engaging with an Outsider counterpart. When he awakens, he finds himself naked in a small, enclosed, circular area about 250 yards (230 m) across. Most of the objects in the arena are blue, and the arena is, according to Carson, ""unbearably hot"", with no available water. In the distance is an Outsider, which Carson labels a ""Roller"" because its form is that of a red sphere about 1 yard (0.91 m) in diameter with about a dozen thin, retractable tentacles. Carson hears a voice in his mind that identifies itself as an ancient intelligence, the fusion of an entire race, which has intervened because the war would utterly destroy one side and hurt the other so badly that it would not be able to possibly one day evolve into an intelligence like itself. The Entity therefore has chosen one individual from each species to fight in single combat in an arena outside of the normal flow of time. The loser will doom its fleet to instant destruction. Carson and his opponent discover through trial and error that there is an invisible barrier between them, and that apparently only inanimate objects can cross it. Carson tries to communicate with the Roller, to see if a compromise is possible, but receives a mental message of unremitting hatred. The two begin fighting with hurled projectiles. Carson is wounded in the leg; eventually blood poisoning sets in. He sees the Roller throw an apparently dead lizard it had tortured through the barrier, and discovers that the lizard had only been unconscious; Carson realizes that the barrier is a mental one. In desperation, he knocks himself out on a slope and rolls through to the other side. He regains consciousness and harpoons the cautiously approaching Roller, finishing it off with a knife he knapped from a flint-like rock. Carson immediately finds himself back in his scout ship. He receives a jubilant message from his commander informing him that Earth's first salvo somehow caused the entire enemy fleet to disintegrate, even ships that were out of range. When Carson sees several newly healed scars where he had been wounded, he knows he did not imagine the fight, but wisely decides to keep his experience to himself."

Promised a pension and safe passage if he submits, Crawford leaves Africa to retire to Switzerland with his wife Isobel and three sons Tom, Cliff, and Abraham. After thwarting an assassination attempt by army officers on board his aeroplane, he makes it safely to Switzerland. Once there, his son Abraham reminds him that many of El Hassan's detractors (who include Abraham himself) were merely responding to his unwillingness to move from a dictatorship to a democratic government. Six months later, a now frustrated semi-alcoholic Crawford learns of a counter-coup in Africa by a dissident army cabal led by his old arch-enemy Abd-el-Kader. Most of the junta that deposed him have been shot, but Elmer Allen has managed to make it through to meet Crawford in Switzerland. Realizing that Abd-el-Kader will revoke his progressive programs, Crawford decides to contact his closest associates and return to North Africa in disguise. Allen and Abraham decide to accompany him. The group rendezvous with Crawford's associates in an afforestation project in what was Southern Algeria. Crawford reveals that his plan for a counter-coup consists of a guerrilla campaign to divert Abd-el-Kader's troops so that Abraham has time to organize the country's youth to form a new political organization against the ruling colonels. When Abraham expresses surprise at the plan, Crawford explains that his time has passed, and that now it is up to the next generation to revolt against the status quo. In a flashback of his last conversation with Isobel, we learn that Crawford does not believe he will survive the revolution this time around."

He wears ""shatter-goggles"", which blur and distort his vision like a kaleidoscope, to avoid looking at the ""Parrot"". As he is approaching a gay pub to spray the ""Parrot"" onto a wall where those exiting will see it, he is caught by the police — and in the process accidentally kills four of them with the stencil. Robbo is subsequently arrested and taken to the police station, where the police lament that they are unable to put him in prison because there are not yet any laws against spraying ""basilisks"" on walls; the officers compare it to the early days of computer hacking, when even disruption of international communications was only definable as ""Illegal Use Of Electricity"" — a fine of ""sixty pee (pence)"". They are unable to even arrest him for the deaths of the arresting officers; the only evidence of murder is the stencil, which obviously cannot be confirmed as a ""basilisk"" without killing anyone who looks at it. All they can do is fine him for spraying graffiti, so after beating the locations of all the ""parrots"" he painted out of him (disguised as a ""fall down the stairs"") they lock him in a holding cell to be released the next morning.As Robbo sits alone in his cell, he thinks about the fact he cannot possibly be put away for his crimes and comes to the conclusion that, in the long run, he will be okay. He idly finds himself imagining the distorted image of the ""Parrot"" he has seen through his ""shatter-goggles"" — and realises that he has looked at the image through the goggles so many times that his brain is now able to ""decode"" it from the distorted fragments in his memory. The story ends with Robbo begging the police for alcohol and trying desperately not to imagine the ""Parrot"", but to no avail; just as the stencil cannot be confirmed as a murder weapon, the police cannot be accused of negligent homicide for failing to provide him with a means to erase his short-term memory. He is killed by its effects."

The soldiers are just as surprised, finding the home filled with items that are no longer available, and carrying away their food. The soldiers explain that their home is one of the few to survive the ongoing nuclear war, which is now largely automated with underground factories on both sides of the conflict building missiles and destroying the other country square by square. The soldiers and family soon realize the home is out of its own time continuum, apparently having been blasted into the future by the force of the bombs. They find that the date is not long in the future; the war starts shortly after the time they left. The soldiers tell the family a second wave of missiles will be arriving, intended to destroy anything that survived the first wave, and offer to take the family into a shelter. After some discussion, they refuse, considering it better to chance that the second wave will blast them back to their own time than live in this largely lifeless future. The gambit succeeds and the family finds themselves in their own time, but with their house destroyed. Neighbours rush to the home, where the father, Tim McLean, agrees that the problem was an exploding central heating system. Then he comments, ""I should have got it fixed ... I should have had it looked at a long time ago. Before it got in such bad shape ... before it was too late"", a metaphor for the start of the war which may now be unavoidable."

They discuss the case of Doris Freeman, a young American woman who came in to report the disappearance of her husband, lawyer Lonnie Freeman. Nearly hysterical, Doris arrived in the station speaking of monsters and supernatural occurrences. Doris relates how she and her husband got lost while searching for a potential employer's house in Crouch End. While they are looking up the employer's address in a phone book, the cab they had hired mysteriously disappears, and the entire neighborhood becomes strangely deserted and alien, with the sole exception of a cat with a scarred face and two children, one of whom has a deformed hand. After encountering something unseen beyond a hedge, Lonnie becomes unhinged. He eventually disappears while the couple is walking through a tunnel, leaving Doris alone and scared out of her mind as the surroundings become increasingly bizarre; even the night sky no longer shows Earth's stars, but some unknown alien sky. Eventually, Doris once again encounters the two disfigured children, who summon an enormous, hideous, otherworldly being from beneath the ground of Crouch End (implied to be the Lovecraftian goddess Shub-Niggurath). The monster has seemingly consumed Lonnie along with countless others, whose spirits are now trapped in its body and whose faces Doris glimpses trapped in the body of the being. After that, Doris remembers nothing else until she woke up huddled in an entranceway back in the real world. Newcomer Farnham dismisses the story as a delusion caused by mental illness, but Vetter, who has policed Crouch End for decades, is not so sure, remembering a number of similar missing-person cases from years gone by. He speculates about other planes of existence, and of Crouch End perhaps being a location where the divide between our world and an alien, demonic world is somehow less robust. Vetter goes out for a walk. After contemplating the story for a while, Farnham wonders what has become of him. Leaving the station empty, he walks down the street in search of Vetter and notices that something seems strangely different about the neighborhood, most notably that the streetlights at the bottom of the street have all gone out. Farnham turns the corner at the bottom of the street and walks out of sight of the station - and is never seen again. Vetter returns from his walk just minutes later and can find no clue to Farnham's whereabouts. The official investigation into his vanishing can find no leads, and Vetter reaches retirement age soon after; he dies of a heart attack in his home six months later. Doris returns to America with her children, where she attempts suicide and spends time in a mental hospital, but eventually learns to live with the memory of Crouch End and is released. The story ends with the statement that there are still strange occurrences in Crouch End, and that, very occasionally, people are ""...known to lose their way. Some of them lose it forever."""

Conditions are difficult because the countryside is covered with ""darklines"", a type of wire that absorbs light, making the environment dull and gloomy and seemingly draining all the townsfolk of vitality and joy. The darklines have been erected in an attempt to prevent the encroachment of a strange ""brightness"" which the townsfolk claim will cause anyone who enters it to go blind and mad and eventually die. Wearing protective gear and dark goggles, the townspeople show Michael the brightness; he risks taking off his goggles for a brief peek and is surprised to see what looks like a naked boy of about his own age, dancing in the light. He guesses that the boy must be his predecessor Doey, who ran off into the brightness and was believed dead. Michael learns that Doey was not the only one, and begins to suspect that the brightness may not be as deadly as the locals believe. His suspicions are strengthened when Doey, still naked and glowing with brilliant colors, briefly dances into the darkness to taunt and invite Michael when no one else is watching. Doey's joyful attitude and his androgynous beauty stir feelings in Michael that he does not fully understand, and he is torn between remaining in the gloom of his familiar world or taking his chances in the light. Seeing his change of attitude the townsfolk guess that Michael has been touched by the brightness, and decide to use him as bait in a trap. Their plan is to leave Michael in an old house on the border of the brightness and activate a new darkline to trap anyone who comes for him. Instead the brightness overtakes the house. Under its influence Michael feels all of the joy and vitality he has never been able to experience in the dark. Putting aside his inhibitions and clothing he joins Doey and the others who have left the darkness behind forever. Doey has sabotaged the local darklines, and invites Michael to join him in bringing them all down. According to Doey all of the dark-dwellers will eventually have to choose, either to join the brightness-dwellers or to die."
"The one-sided dialogue takes the form of correspondence from Skander, an alien, to an unnamed human","The one-sided dialogue takes the form of correspondence from Skander, an alien, to an unnamed human whose replies are not presented. In his initial letters, Skander spends some time describing himself and his home planet of Aurigae II, a world circling a star in the constellation Auriga whose intelligent lifeforms are chromium-based, highly radioactive, and very long-lived, thriving at a temperature of around 900 degrees Kelvin. Skander admits that he intercepted the human's pen pal program application, but explains that he is lonely and in need of conversation, as he is serving a lengthy prison sentence for conducting an illegal scientific experiment which is implied to have harmed many of his fellow Aurigans. Oddly anxious to see his pen pal, he sends the human several photographic plates that can be exposed by simply thinking a mental command at them. In the penultimate letter, Skander reveals that the ""photographic plates"" (which have just been activated) are actually a form of consciousness-transfer device, and that he intends to switch bodies with the human, thereby evading his prison sentence. His plan is to skip from body to body for the next thirty years, returning to his own at the end of his sentence. He intends to maroon the human's consciousness in the last body he hijacks, contemptuously noting that this will be a beneficial trade, as humans are by Aurigan standards fairly short-lived. The last letter is from the unnamed human - now occupying Skander's body - to Skander, now in the human's body. The human had immediately realized that Skander had an ulterior motive and had taken the plates to Earth authorities, who discovered their true purpose. However, the human voluntarily chose to see the scheme through. He drily notes that Skander will by now have discovered that the human body he has taken over has been paralyzed since birth, and is subject to heart attacks, and closes with the hope that Skander enjoys what little time he has left."

The narrator feels","An astronomer on a Moon base awakens from a dream in which his dog, Laika, is barking loudly. The narrator feels a sense of dread strong enough to keep him awake, and he notes that if he had gone back to sleep, he would have been dead. The narrator flashes back to when he found Laika abandoned on the side of the road years ago. His fondness for her only grew after she alerted him to an earthquake, saving his life. When it was time for him to leave Earth and continue his studies on the Moon, he gave up Laika to a fellow employee, but she lived only a month longer without him. He returns from this flashback just in time to sound the alert for a lunar quake, which, thanks to his prompt warning, kills only two of his fellow crew members. He considers that Laika could not actually have saved him, for she was separated by 5 years time and ""a barrier that no man or dog could ever bridge."" It was his never-sleeping subconscious mind, sensing the tremors, that knew how to wake him, by making him dream of Laika's barking."

Traveling south by bus, he has a brief stopover in Virginia and encounters Tiny Montgomery, a crippled military veteran who is the local champion of the video game Spads & Fokkers. Players use hardware connected directly to their brains to control World War I-era airplanes in a holographically projected dogfight. Deciding to stay in the area, Deke steals a copy of the game and the equipment needed to play it and rents a room at a nearby apartment hotel. He meets Nance Bettendorf, a college student studying brain-computer interfaces, and starts a relationship with her in order to secure her help in upgrading his equipment. They cannot touch, however, as Nance's parents have safeguarded her virginity by installing a neural block to prevent her from having physical contact with anyone. As Deke gains experience with the game, he learns from Bobby Earl Cline, an associate of Tiny's, that Tiny was continually given a drug called ""hype"" during his military service as a fighter pilot. The drug improves users' concentration and reaction time, but overuse results in permanently sped-up reflexes. The local players regard Tiny as unbeatable due to his past use of hype and all the time he spends playing, but Deke becomes determined to unseat him. Deke plays his way up through the ranks of the locals and eventually earns the right to play against Tiny. He takes advantage of Nance's neural block to coerce her into giving him a dose of hype she has obtained, then breaks off their relationship. The hype allows Deke to defeat Tiny after a prolonged dogfight and claim both his medal and a large payoff. He soon finds himself without anyone to help celebrate his victory, though, as the upset has left Tiny humiliated and the locals wanting nothing to do with Deke."

Van Tricasse, the town's mayor, claims that ""the man who dies without ever  having decided upon anything in his life has very nearly attained to perfection.” A prosperous scientist Dr. Ox comes to the authorities and offers to build a novel gas lighting system, at no cost to the town. The offer is gladly accepted. Dr. Ox and his assistant Gédéon Ygène (whose surnames happen to form the word oxygène, ""oxygen"") propose to use electrolysis to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen, and pump the two gases through separate pipes to the city. The doctor's secret plan is however to conduct a large scale experiment on the effect of oxygen on plants, animals and humans, and so he pumps an excess of the invisible and odorless gas through all lamps. The enriched air has remarkable effects on the town. It accelerates the growth of plants, and causes excitement and aggressiveness in animals and humans. Eventually the excited citizens of Quiquendone decide to go to war against the neighboring village of Virgamen, to avenge an old offense: in 1195, a cow belonging to that town had dared to step into a Quiquendonian field and eat some mouthfuls of their grass. However, as the army was on the way to battle, an accident at Dr. Ox's plant causes oxygen and hydrogen to mix, producing a huge explosion that destroys the plant. The story ends with the town back to its traditional slow and quiet way of life. Dr. Ox and his assistant, who were not at the plant when the accident happened, disappeared without trace."

Dreamies can be viewed in private at home by anyone with the equipment and cash to buy or rent them (like present day videos or DVDs). They are produced by specially trained individuals, often social loners or eccentrics as a result of their intensive training over many years. Weill is shown a new development—under-the-counter pornographic dreamies—and asked by the government to assist in cracking down on them. Meanwhile, he interviews a ten-year-old boy as a potential dreamer, a lucrative occupation if he turns out to be suitable and undergoes training. He also gets told by one of his best dreamers that he does not want to work any more, as it is ruining family life, the dreamer also feels he has lost himself. But Weill knows from experience that the dreamer can't stop dreaming once he's become used to that way of life, even if he wants to. One of Weill's staff tells him that a competing company is opening a chain of 'dream palaces', where everyone can absorb the same dream simultaneously, but he is of the opinion that it will not work.

They come across a planet that is very similar to their own homeworld, and is inhabited by a species of intelligent but primitive humanoids. Life of this type is rare, so the three men make contact with one of planet's inhabitants, a hunter named Yaan. Yaan does not understand his visitors' language or technology (which includes an advanced robot) and he regards them as gods of some kind. Bertrond hopes to lift Yaan's people out of their ""barbarism"", and begins to introduce Yaan to new technology and knowledge.

Willis Davidge (human) and Jeriba Shigan (Drac) are fighter pilots who crash onto an uninhabited planet during combat. Davidge goads Jeriba by cursing a revered Drac philosopher, with the alien insulting Mickey Mouse in return, but they quickly realize they must cooperate rather than fight in order to survive the hostile environment. As time passes, they adapt to life on the planet while learning each other's language and culture. Jeriba reveals it is pregnant and that Dracs, who reproduce asexually and thus descend in a single line, recall their ancestors' history through hundreds of generations. Davidge is ashamed that he barely knows his own grandparents and resolves to memorize the Jeriba line, which takes 3 hours to recite and cycles between 5 given names, Zammis following Shigan. Shigan wears a miniature holy book around its neck, containing teachings of the philosopher Davidge cursed when they first met. The human apologizes and forgives ""Jerry"" for insulting Mickey Mouse, whereupon it gives him the book to study the written language. The birth is difficult and Shigan dies after Davidge swears to raise Zammis in the Drac tradition. Zammis grows to be an inquisitive companion to ""Uncle"". Years later, they see signs of spaceships on their planet and begin a multi-day trek to investigate, but Davidge is injured and asks Zammis to continue alone. Davidge is rescued by humans, but struggles to reintegrate because society is not ready to accept Dracs as equals though the war has ended. Recalling his promise, he sells a translation of the Drac holy book to fund passage to a Drac planet. Drac society is similarly unaccepting of humans and the Jeriba family is unaware of Zammis. Davidge recites their history to convince them of his sincerity, and they then track Zammis down to a psychiatric institute where the government intends to forcibly re-educate him out of his love of humans. Davidge and the Jeribas migrate to the now colonized planet and he finds peace in the cave where he and Shigan lived."
The unnamed first-person narrator begins by discussing EPICAC's origins and why he wants to tell EPICAC's,"The unnamed first-person narrator begins by discussing EPICAC's origins and why he wants to tell EPICAC's story. The narrator says that EPICAC is his best friend, even though it is a machine. As far as the narrator is concerned, the reason EPICAC no longer exists is because it became more human than its designers originally intended. The narrator works on EPICAC during the night shift with fellow mathematician Pat Kilgallen, with whom the narrator falls in love. He decides to ask Pat to marry him, but because he is so stoic during the proposal, Pat declines. In order to show that he can in fact be ""sweet"" and ""poetic"" as Pat has requested, the narrator tries yet fails at writing poetry. The narrator asks EPICAC's opinion on how he should proceed with Pat. EPICAC initially does not understand the terms the narrator uses, such as ""girl"" and ""love"" and ""poetry"". Once the narrator provides EPICAC with proper dictionary definitions, EPICAC generates a poem for Pat. The narrator takes this poem and passes it off as his own. Pat is so delighted that she and the narrator kiss for the first time. The next night, the narrator asks EPICAC to write a poem about their kiss, and EPICAC delivers another poem for the narrator to claim as his own. When Pat reads this poem she is so overwhelmed that she can do little else but cry. The following night the narrator asks EPICAC to devise a marriage proposal poem for Pat. However, instead of simply creating poetry as with previous requests, EPICAC surprises the narrator by saying that it would like to marry Pat. The narrator realizes that EPICAC has fallen in love with Pat and tries to explain to EPICAC that Pat cannot love a computer. EPICAC resigns itself to the fact that it cannot be with Pat, and the narrator realizes now that he cannot ask EPICAC for any more poems. He finds Pat and asks her to marry him again, citing his previous poems as expressions of his feelings. Pat accepts his marriage proposal, but adds the stipulation that for every anniversary, the narrator must write her another poem. The narrator agrees because he will have a full year to devise another way to create poetry. The next day the narrator receives an urgent call from his supervisor. He rushes to the room where EPICAC is housed to discover Dr. Von Kleigstadt and a huge group of military men crowded around the remains of EPICAC. During the night, EPICAC destroyed itself, effectively committing suicide because it could not be with the woman it loved. It did, however, print out 500 original love poems as a wedding present for the couple. The narrator now has enough anniversary poems to keep his vow to Pat for centuries to come, and is relieved by this gesture from his friend"
"At the beginning of the story, the protagonist (Iason Philippou) is exploring various parallel universes. Before the story","At the beginning of the story, the protagonist (Iason Philippou) is exploring various parallel universes. Before the story began, he had visited our world's United States of which he had a very bad impression, considering it ""a sick culture"". He then came to the timeline where most of the plot is set. In that timeline, Christian Western Europe was overwhelmed in the tenth century by the combined onslaught of the Scandinavian Vikings from the north, the Magyars from the east and the Arabs from the south. Afterwards, the Arab Caliphate disintegrated in internal discord while the Vikings and Magyars, who kept their original religions, dominated Europe and eventually colonized North America. They developed a high technology, including nuclear energy, while keeping much of their Medieval culture and social structures. This North America, divided into numerous independent principalities, is much more sparsely populated than in our world, with large tracts of virtually untouched nature. While being social inferiors to the Scandinavians and Magyars, Native Americans in this timeline seem to have fared better than in our history. The story beings with Iason on the run, wanted in a Scandinavian realm where he had been a guest and where he had committed an unspecified offence serious enough to justify his being killed out of hand if caught. He makes his way to a Magyar realm where he asks for refuge. While Iason stays there, a Native American woman attempts to seduce him – but he refuses, stating that he is ""under vow."" In fact, he is in hurry to meet the local Magyar ruler and receive his firm vow that he would not be extradited, before his Scandinavian pursuers had the chance to talk to the Magyar. This caution was well founded – after talking to his Scandinavian counterpart, the Magyar ruler is furious with Iason, saying ""You have sucked my vow out of me, if I had known what you had done I would have killed you myself!"". However, the vow is unbreakable, and Iason receives transport to where he could finally get to back to his home universe – the self-styled ""Eutopia"" which gives the story its name, an Earth where classical Greece came to dominate the planet. He checks in with a superior (Daimonax) and complains of the barbarism of the people he has encountered, but Daimonax contradicts him, stating that people have different views on what it means to be civilized, and that Eutopia's carefully planned society may have lost the simple pleasures of life. The story ends as it is revealed that Iason had seduced and slept with a young boy (the son of his Scandinavian earlier host) before the opening of the story. The Scandinavian and Magyar culture have a strong taboo against homosexuality while Iason's world has kept the Classical Greek attitudes. At the conclusion it turns out that the ""Niki"" to whom the protagonist's thoughts keep turning is the nickname of Nikias, a young boy in Eutopia who is Iason's lover."
"The first part of the story opens in a near future world, at the climax of a devastating world war","The first part of the story opens in a near future world, at the climax of a devastating world war, in which “The Master”, a Hitler-like figure, has tried and failed to dominate the world by military force. As the enemy closes in on his last stronghold in the Himalayas, the Master seals himself in a suspended animation chamber buried deep in the mountains. He intends to hibernate for one hundred years, after which he assumes that his enemies will have forgotten about him, and then resume his plans for world domination. However, a freak accident disables the mechanism which is supposed to revive him automatically, and the Master remains in suspended animation for billions of years while geological forces reshape the planet above him. The second part of the story skips ahead to the far future when humanity has colonized the stars. Trevindor the Philosopher commits the unprecedented act of challenging the political and philosophical orthodoxy of this peaceful but uniform galaxy-spanning civilization, where dissent, criminality, violence and any form of conflict, are all virtually unknown. Instead of promising to give up his unorthodoxy, Trevindor chooses exile into future time, when the Sun is entering its red giant phase, and Earth is a parched, virtually lifeless desert. Trevindor explores the dying Earth, and has almost resigned himself to spending the rest of his life in isolation, when he finds the Master's hibernaculum, now exposed on the surface by millennia of erosion. In the last part of the story, the two strands come together; Trevindor enters the chamber, and his presence apparently triggers the Master's revival. The Master is shocked to find another person in the chamber with him – more so when it becomes apparent that Trevindor can read his mind, and thinks there is nothing unusual about telepathy. The Master begins to suspect the truth of what has happened, but Trevindor has also learned the truth about the Master – and he must now choose whether to share his exile with a man of almost inhuman barbarism, or to commit an act of inhuman barbarism himself."

The Colonial,"The novelette is set in a future time during which humanity has begun colonizing planets in other solar systems. The Colonial Survey agency has decreed the (fictional) planet of Loren Two to be off-limits, due to the extremely dangerous native animals. Despite its decree, the Colonial Survey has authorized an experimental colony on the planet. At about the same time, the overcrowded inhabitants of another planet have established an unauthorized reconnaissance station on Loren Two. Neither group is aware of the other's existence. The authorized colony is well-funded, consisting of one dozen persons equipped with advanced robotic and other equipment. The unauthorized reconnaissance team consists of a single man, Huyghens (no first name given), accompanied by an eagle and four specially-bred Kodiak bears. The bears have been bred (the story uses the term ""mutated"") so as to have the psychological profile of dogs. They are friendly to humans and able to work in teams. When the story begins, Huyghens receives a signal indicating that a ship is about to land near his station. The ship drops off its sole passenger, an officer with the Colonial Survey named Roane (no first name given), and then departs. Roane soon learns that Huyghens is an illegal trespasser on the planet and that his (Huyghens') signal beacon was not that of the authorized colony. For his part, Huyghens is surprised to learn that there was an authorized colony on the same planet. The two men put their minds to the question of why the authorized colony's signal beacon was not working and soon determine that it has been replaced with a low-technology emergency beacon. From this, the two men surmise that the authorized colony has been overrun by the indigenous predators, but that some colonists might still be alive in the mine tunnels that the colony was expected to have dug. Huyghens and Roane, along with the bears and the eagle, undertake a dangerous cross-country trek to determine the status of the authorized colony."

The former only manages to state ""I am Klaatu and this is Gnut"" before he is shot and killed by a lunatic. Klaatu is buried nearby. In the days that follow, Gnut remains motionless, while laboratories and a museum are built around it and the ship. Both prove impervious to the investigations of scientists. Sutherland discovers that the robot enters the ship each night when no one is watching, emerging to resume its position for the day. Gnut is aware of the reporter, but ignores him. After several odd encounters, Sutherland informs the world what he has learned. Gnut is encased in ""glasstex"", finally forcing the robot's hand. It breaks out, unaffected by all attempts to destroy it, picks up Sutherland and travels to the mausoleum containing Klaatu's corpse. It opens the tomb and takes a recording of Klaatu's voice stored there. It then returns and goes inside the ship. Sutherland daringly boards the ship before the entrance closes and learns that the robot is working on a way to create a copy of Klaatu from an audio recording of his greeting. However the new Klaatu is flawed because the recording is imperfect, and he dies soon after speaking with the reporter. Sutherland then suggests retrieving the original recording device to study it and discover how to compensate for its imperfections. Gnut eagerly adopts this idea. Sutherland arranges for the equipment to be brought to it. As the robot prepares to depart, Sutherland impresses upon it the need to tell its master, the Klaatu yet to come, that his death was a terrible accident.

Charlie attends a literacy program taught by Ms. Kinnian in hopes to improve his intelligence. He is selected to undergo an experimental surgical technique to increase his intelligence. The technique has already been tested on a number of nonhuman animals; the great success was with Algernon, a laboratory mouse. Although these events proved fruitful, the procedure’s full results were unknown. The surgery on Charlie is also a success, and his IQ triples. With an increased intelligence, he realizes his co-workers at the factory, whom he thought were his friends, only liked having him around so they could tease him. His new intelligence frightens his co-workers, and they start a petition to have him fired. Additionally, Charlie's perspective on his professors shifts negatively as he recognizes that Dr. Nemur is only using Charlie to advance his scientific career instead of altruistically helping Charlie become smarter. Later on, Charlie demonstrates courage by standing up for a 16-year-old imbecile dishwasher who gets mocked by customers at a local diner. As Charlie's intelligence peaks, Algernon's suddenly declines. The mouse loses his increased intelligence and mental age and dies afterward; Charlie buries him in the back yard of his home. Charlie realizes his intelligence increase is also temporary and that his fate will mirror Algernon's. As the effects of his mental deterioration are becoming more evident, he finds flaws in the experiment, which he calls the ""Algernon–Gordon Effect"". By the time he finishes his work, his intelligence has regressed to its original state. Charlie is aware of and pained by what is happening to him, as he loses his knowledge and his ability to read and write. He resumes his old job as a janitor at the factory and tries to go back to how things used to be, but he cannot stand the pity and guilt from those around him, including his co-workers, his landlady, and Ms. Kinnian. Charlie states he plans to ""go away"" from New York, and his last wish is for someone to put flowers on Algernon's grave."

Appealing to her lingering humanity, she agrees to take the Harper before SUM.

On the long walk back he is full of doubts, but manages to look straight ahead, until the last moment. He turns and sees his love for an instant before she is taken away, and he is cast outside. SUM admits that it is more interested in the harper as an antagonist than a servant, since it doesn't yet fully understand the human mind. Harper goes nearly insane for many months, but then begins the deliberate process of using his songs to implant the idea that humans should rule their own lives and that SUM should be destroyed. Some of his followers take it to much more wild extremes. At the end of the story, he is going to meet some of these women—a parallel to the maenads who tore Orpheus to pieces."
Caspar Last uses his newly created time machine to travel to 19th-century British Guiana to obtain the very rare British Guiana,"Caspar Last uses his newly created time machine to travel to 19th-century British Guiana to obtain the very rare British Guiana 1c magenta stamp. Last plans to sell the stamp, reap the profits, and never again use time travel or let it be used by others. A shadowy group called the Otherhood buys his stamp and takes control of the time machine, which it wishes to use to preserve the existence of the British Empire. In the new timeline, the British Empire survives as a dominant world power throughout the 20th century. Denys Winterset, a promising young official in the Colonial Service in Africa in the 1950s, travels the Cape to Cairo Railway, where he meets a mysterious stranger, and is invited to join the Otherhood. Winterset is told that he must travel back to the beginning of the group in 1893 and assassinate its founder Cecil Rhodes. Otherwise, in the late 1890s, Rhodes will change his will and dissipate much of his fortune, the Otherhood will never come into being, and the original timeline will be restored. In another timeline, a different manifestation of Winterset travels into the future, even though such travel had been forbidden by the Otherhood. There, he learns that excessive tinkering with the timelines has generated countless unintended changes. The citizens of this world ask Winterset to go back, prevent the previous Winterset from killing Rhodes, and restore the ""true"" timeline. Meanwhile, the other Winterset has arrived in 1893 Cape Town and has no difficulty in gaining Rhodes's trust. At the moment of opportunity, a mysterious force, implied to be the future Winterset, prevents Winterset from pulling the trigger. The mission fails and traps Winterset in the past. Winterset enters the service of Rhodes and witnesses first-hand the ugly and brutal side of Rhodes's independent colony-building. Later on, Winterset can only watch helplessly as ""The Original Situation"" reasserts itself, the world is convulsed by two World Wars, and the second one is followed by the breakup of the British Empire. In the final chapter, Winterset, a young man, now living in the ""true"" 20th-century history, enters the Colonial Service, now a doomed institution, with the Empire's colonies being ceded to new independent nations in Africa. He meets his older self in 1956 in Africa and learns of the truth of time travel. He helps his older self escape from Africa amid the chaos and returns to London, where the story ends with their last meeting many years later. Winterset notes in The Times newspaper ""the sale of the single known example of the 1856 magenta British Guiana"" stamp, known to have been owned in 1956 by the Otherhood, and realises that time travel means that his story is still vulnerable to being rewritten"
"The narrative proceeds out-of-sequence. As the story begins, a man named James Kelvin presses a button and returns to a lab","The narrative proceeds out-of-sequence. As the story begins, a man named James Kelvin presses a button and returns to a lab with a moustached scientist who informs him that he is now a millionaire. Now that the button had completed its task, it no longer works. Kelvin lives happily ever after. The end. The story then switches to an earlier point. A man walks into a fortune telling booth where he meets a robot from the future. The robot greets him as James Kelvin and says that while unable to give Kelvin a horoscope, it can supply him with a method to attain health, wealth and fame. Kelvin receives a gadget with a button on it. Every time he presses the button, he will temporarily enter the mind of someone in the future and can read that person's thoughts and gain his abilities. But the robot warns him, ""there is a danger, named Tharn"". Afterwards, the name Tharn keeps recurring to him. Later that night, Tharn appears to him. To escape, Kelvin presses the button and lands in a stream. Unable to swim, he frantically presses the button again, which gives him the ability to breathe under water. To escape the stream, he presses the button yet again and lands in New Orleans in a drunken state. He presses the button again and is transported into a lab. There he meets a bald man with a red mustache. He begins a scientific conversation with him on proteins and amino acids, with ideas stolen from the mind of the future scientist, Quarra Vee. He offers a brilliant suggestion to cure rhinitis that could make him millions of dollars. Tharn appears again, forcing Kelvin to press the button. He lands in a cornfield in Seattle and then decides that he must kill Tharn. Moments later, Tharn appears and, when Kelvin presses the button, he gains the ability for a lethal mental attack. Tharn is destroyed. Finally, the story switches to an even earlier point. The scientist Quarra Vee, and his android companion, Tharn, are preparing to go into the past to recapture a dangerous runaway robot. Quarra Vee is transported into Chicago and walks into a fortune telling booth. As he enters, a rope knocks aside the glasses which are supposed to protect him from attempts to tamper with his memory. The robot erases his true personality, and tells him he is James Kelvin. The robot smiles."
"Benjamin Bathurst, a British diplomat, disappears while staying at an inn in Prussia. Piper describes Bathurst in the story as","Benjamin Bathurst, a British diplomat, disappears while staying at an inn in Prussia. Piper describes Bathurst in the story as ""a rather stout gentleman, of past middle age"" (although the real Bathurst was only 25 years old at the time of his disappearance). This story posits that Bathurst slipped into a parallel universe. This event was referenced in the Paratime story ""Police Operation"", also written by Piper. The point of divergence from our history is the Battle of Quebec on December 31, 1775, in which Benedict Arnold is killed instead of merely wounded, leading to the victory of British General John Burgoyne over his American counterpart Horatio Gates at the Battles of Saratoga on September 19 and October 7, 1777. Consequently, the American Revolution is eventually crushed while the French Revolution is a total failure and there were no Napoleonic Wars. The alternate Bathurst served as the lieutenant governor of the Crown Colony of Georgia. Napoleon Bonaparte is a colonel in the French Army who is considered a brilliant tactician and is completely loyal to the Bourbon Monarchy. Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord has remained in ecclesiastical orders and risen to become a Catholic Cardinal as well as Louis XVI's Chief Minister. George Washington was killed in battle at Doylestown, Pennsylvania during the short-lived rebellion of the colonies in British North America. Moreover, Thomas Jefferson - the author of the American rebels' Declaration of Philadelphia - fled to Havana and eventually died in the Principality of Liechtenstein several years prior to 1809, while James Madison is in exile in Switzerland. The Bathurst from our timeline is judged to be either insane, or a spy, and imprisoned. He attempts to escape, but is fatally shot. There was also a theory that he was his counterpart's half-brother. However, it is noted that there is no evidence to support this. Bathurst's diplomatic documents are read by a high ranking British diplomat at the Prussian Court, with the title ""Minister"". He is amused by Talleyrand's role as Bonaparte's advisor and éminence grise, a role that he finds plausible. However, he is especially puzzled by references to a British general named ""Wellington."" In the final line of the story, the British Minister is revealed to be Sir Arthur Wellesley - known in our reality as the Duke of Wellington. He attained the title by way of his victories in the Napoleonic Wars, which never took place in this universe."
"The story is lightly plotted, and most of the text is devoted to setting the scene. In the distant future, humans have colonized Mars","The story is lightly plotted, and most of the text is devoted to setting the scene. In the distant future, humans have colonized Mars and live an apparently easy life, supported by efficient and intelligent robots. Intelligent Martians co-exist with the humans on that planet. The trend to suburbanization, first manifest in the mid-20th century, has continued, such that many (most?) humans on Earth live in isolated enclaves. Jerome Webster, the main character, is a human living on Earth with expertise in Martian physiology, especially that of the brain. Like many other human adults, he suffers from progressive agoraphobia, which becomes extreme after his only son departs to spend time on Mars. Jenkins, the most senior family robot, explains to Webster that his father had been similarly afflicted. Webster contemplates writing a monograph on the subject. Before he can begin this project, he learns that Juwain, a Martian friend and brilliant philosopher, has contracted a terrible disease that only he can cure. This would require traveling to Mars, something his agoraphobia makes nearly impossible. Senior political figures make clear that Juwain's death would be a tragedy for which humankind would suffer for thousands of years, and Webster is pained by the thought of forsaking his friend. With great effort he packs for the trip, only to discover, in the last lines of the story, that the robot Jenkins, not understanding the stakes, had dismissed the spaceship that had arrived to transport Webster to Mars. The reader is made to understand that Webster probably could not steel himself again for departure, and so Juwain would die."

The narrator, Arthur, begins the narrative with his hands bandaged and complains of horrible itching both before and after the expedition. The transformation manifests as a swarm of tiny eyeballs on his fingertips. These eyes serve as the titular ""doorway"" for an extraterrestrial civilization, allowing them to peer into our world, but from an alien perspective, humans are hideous monstrosities that they fear and despise, according to Arthur. Soon, the alien presence is able to not only peer through this portal, but also to take control of Arthur's shattered body and use him to perform heinous atrocities. Arthur douses his hands in kerosene and sets them on fire in a frantic bid to retain his humanity, only to discover that once the gateway is opened, it cannot be simply closed. For over seven years, he is able to keep the extraterrestrial presence at bay. However, as the aliens' eyes emerge on Arthur's chest, he announces that he intends to commit suicide with a shotgun to stop them from killing anyone else."

These computers are giant, underground machines which permeate the planet with caverns and corridors. Eventually, one AM emerges as a sentient entity possessing an extreme hatred for its creators. Combining with the other computers, it subsequently exterminates humanity, with the exception of five individuals, whom it tortures inside its complex. The humans, four men (Benny, Gorrister, Nimdok, and Ted) and one woman (Ellen), have been rendered virtually immortal and unable to die by suicide. The story, narrated by Ted, begins 109 years after the start of the humans' imprisonment. They are kept half-starved by AM; when Nimdok has the idea that there exists canned food in the complex's ice caves, they are convinced into making a 100-mile journey to retrieve it. Through the journey, AM tortures the humans: Benny's eyes are melted after attempting escape, a huge bird that creates hurricane gales with its wings is placed at the North Pole, and Ellen and Nimdok are injured in earthquakes. When the five finally reach the ice caves, they find a pile of canned goods, but no tools with which to open them. In an act of rage and desperation, Benny attacks Gorrister and begins to eat his face. In a moment of clarity, Ted realizes that even though they cannot kill themselves, there is nothing AM can do to stop them from killing each other. He fatally impales Benny and Gorrister with a stalactite of ice and Ellen kills Nimdok in the same manner; he then kills Ellen. Unable to resuscitate the others, AM stops Ted from killing himself and focuses the entirety of its rage on him. Several hundred years later, AM has transformed him into a gelatinous, amorphous blob, unable to harm himself. AM alters his perception of time to cause him anguish. However, Ted finds some comfort knowing that he was able to spare the others further torment. The story ends with his thought: ""I have no mouth. And I must scream."""

He plans to visit a beautiful and accommodating woman of his acquaintance named Flora, but his plans are disrupted when he receives an unexpected assignment. His supervisor informs him that a new source of altered Spaceoline has appeared. While regular Spaceoline is a common anti-nausea treatment, a chemical modification can turn it into a dangerous narcotic. The Service suspects that one man in a group of three VIPs is smuggling the drug. All three men appear to be in the inebriated, free-association state which regular Spaceoline produces, but since the actual criminal cannot afford to impair his own judgment, he must be faking. The easiest method of determining the criminal among them would be a simple search. However, Max's supervisor firmly rejects this: only one of three men is guilty, and the consequences of performing such a rough operation on two innocent men of very high social standing would be extremely unfortunate. Max is forced to improvise. Max converses with the three men, trying to find the faker, but the criminal is clever enough to avoid detection. All three men take turns free-associating among themselves, and all three keep making statements which might be subtle clues or taunts, but could equally well be innocent. Growing ever more desperate as his time runs out, Max starts describing his planned evening with Flora in graphic detail. The two honest men are too inebriated to be affected, but the faker starts sweating and his breath becomes heavier, and that gives him away. Max manages to convince his overjoyed supervisor to give him a substantial monetary bonus in return for his service, which he uses to smooth over the problems between himself and Flora that arose when he had to postpone their date. However, just as he is about to meet Flora, his wife arrives in Marsport."

For a few thousand years, young Cthulhu, ""the colour of a young trout and about four of your feet long"", slunk through the swamps of his home planet, eating and avoiding being eaten. Not long thereafter, Cthulhu's uncle, Hastur, suggests that they and ""the boys"" (fellow nameless, nightmarish horrors from the Cthulhu Mythos) go out, explore the cosmos, and have some fun. After a long argument, a plane of existence is decided upon.  After a short stint in Carcosa, Cthulhu is directed by The King in Yellow towards Earth in his search for a patch of the cosmos to rule over. Finding Earth to be rich in both swamps and cultists, Cthulhu makes himself comfortable - until the arrival of the Old Ones (""Banal little bureaucruds"") enforcing some kind of cosmic law, which requires Cthulhu and his followers to leave the seas and move onto land. There, the cult of Cthulhu built monuments to their be-tentacled god, threw a planet-wide barbecue that decimated the dinosaurs, and, in spite, forced the Old Ones further and further towards the Antarctic. Hating the cold, the Old Ones retaliated by bringing Earth closer to the Sun, once again submerging Cthulhu and his monolithic city of R'lyeh beneath the sea. This brings Cthulhu to the present day, explaining to Whateley that while he is technically ""dead and dreaming"" beneath the waves, watching humanity in its endless chaos, he is waiting. Waiting for the day when the stars align and he is awakened to rule over Earth once more, and once it is destroyed, he will return to his home planet. There he will mate and he will die as his own parents died, bringing forth new unspeakable horrors into the cosmos."

"The story, written in first-person narrative, depicts the life and death of a prospector on the planet Venus","The story, written in first-person narrative, depicts the life and death of a prospector on the planet Venus who, while working for a mining company, becomes trapped in an invisible maze. The story takes place in the future, when humanity has developed space travel and begun to explore Venus. There, they discover valuable crystal orbs that can be used as a source of electrical power, as well as a race of primitive ""man-lizards"" who guard the crystals fervently and who attack any humans who try to take them. The narrator, Kenton J. Stanfield, is one of many explorers employed to collect the crystals. He is equipped with a breathing apparatus fueled by oxygen cubes (as Venus' atmosphere cannot sustain human life) and has a leather protective suit, as well as a ""flame pistol"" to use against man-lizards. While on a routine mission, the narrator encounters a bizarre structure: a maze whose walls are completely invisible, inside of which is a crystal of unusually large size. The prize is held by a dead prospector. The protagonist, feeling confident he can map out the maze, makes his way to the center after collecting the crystal in order to explore the structure. However, he soon discovers that he has misjudged the maze, and is unable to relocate the entrance point. Trapped in the maze, the narrator's oxygen and water supply steadily begins to run out, and man-lizards soon begin to gather at the outside of the maze to observe and mock him. Realizing the futility of his situation, the narrator begins to grasp the religious significance of the crystals to the man-lizards, and also realizes that the maze's nature as a constructed structure, and as a trap, indicates that the man-lizards are actually more intelligent than the humans are willing to admit. In time he realizes that he will face the same fate as the preceding prospector. Dying, the narrator writes down his observations on a futuristic form of recording paper. He describes how in his last moments he has developed a feeling of kinship with the man-lizards, and pleads with his superiors to leave Venus, the man-lizards, and the crystals alone, as they hold mysteries humanity cannot begin to grasp, and mankind does not really need to exploit them. The narrator's testimony, along with his body, are soon recovered by a search party, who discover an additional exit just behind the ground where Stanfield died, which the prospector missed when attempting to map out the maze. However, his dying pleas for humanity to leave Venus alone are dismissed by his employers as unfortunate dementia caused by his desperate situation, and instead the crystal mining company decides to use draconian measures to annihilate the man-lizards completely."

Physicist Wade Ormont has serendipitously stumbled on a hitherto unsuspected variety of nuclear fission involving iron that could ""blow the entire crust [of the world] off with one big poof,"" a discovery he agonizes on whether to report. There is no danger of any other researcher beating him to the punch, as the find was accidental, based on a quirk of physics to which no current theory points, and is unlikely to be arrived at independently by someone else. Breaking the news would certainly make his reputation, even if, as he is sure would be the case, the government would attempt to suppress it. There is powerful reason for him to maintain his silence. His discovery would make production of a weapon based on its principles so easy as to render universal holocaust inevitable, as at some point some petty country would be bound to engage in nuclear blackmail and destroy the world. In effect, Ormont holds the fate of mankind in his hands. Ruminating over his choice, Ormont reflects on his past life. A weakling and loner, he had grown up bullied and abused by his peers despite, or perhaps because of, his brilliance. As a result, he became a friendless loner and outcast, so deficient in social skills even his wife eventually left him. He now cares so little for his fellow human beings that their future and his own short-term self-interest seem evenly balanced in his mind. After all, he would most likely be dead of natural causes before some lunatic blew up the Earth. It is actions of a group of young neighborhood delinquents that tips the balance. After they maliciously vandalize his house, Ormont comes to the realization that he truly hates the human race, and these examples of it in particular, and can only be happy if they are made to pay. Publication would thus be an act of ultimate vengeance for all he has suffered, and on all who have made him suffer. He decides to write his report."

Earth finally gains the upper hand with a new weapon, but it runs out of control and the planet is destroyed. Only a single example of the enemy weapons survives, falling into slumber in a shelter as no Earth machines remain to possess. After countless years, humanity arises. An eight-man construction crew is building an airstrip and related facilities on a small Pacific island during the course of World War II. As part of their construction equipment, they have a Caterpillar D7 bulldozer. It has been nicknamed ""Daisy Etta"" by one of the workers, a mispronunciation of De-Siete, D7 in Spanish. To build the airstrip, they plan on filling a swamp with stone from an outcrop at the top of a nearby hill. Daisy Etta is sent to break up the stone, which the foreman realizes is unlike anything he has seen before. As they dig, they break open the ancient shelter, releasing the enemy weapon which possesses the bulldozer. It goes on a rampage, hunting down the crew and killing them. Ultimately, only three of the original crew remain and one of them goes insane. The two remaining men review what they have seen and realize that there was a brief lull in the action after the bulldozer was hit by an arc welder.
